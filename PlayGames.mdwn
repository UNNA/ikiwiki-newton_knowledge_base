It's a computer -- of course you can play games on it.

There are a ton of games at [UNNA|http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games], but here are some good ones with descriptions and links:

* [SquashEm | http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/SquashEm1.0] is Newton's (OS 2.x) version of the classic "Whack a Mole" game.  I recommend playing only with a screen protector and gently at that.  Squish the spiders, but please don't hurt the innocent woodland creatures!
* [nZone | http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/nZone] is a !BattleZone clone for your Newt.  However, its use of the screen leaves something to be desired.  It's also an early version, with nothing to do but to drive around the landscape, shooting at geometric shapes which never blow up.
* [Lunar Lander | http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/LunarLander] is a gorgeously-rendered version of the classic computer game, complete with sound.
* [Daleks | http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/Daleks/] is a version of the classic make-the-dumb-robots-smash-into-each-other game, based on the old Mac game of the same name (which is based on the old BSD game 'robots')
* Chess is always popular on PDAs, and UNNA offers a bunch of Chess games. [DeepGreen1.0b3| http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/DeepGreen1.0b3] is a favorite of many players.
* [Solo DX|http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/SoloDX1.62] is probably the best Klondike Solitaire game for the Newton.  It also plays Canfield and Pyramid, and keeps track of your score in an interesting way.  Also features different card backs.
* [Newtiles|http://www.unna.org/view.php?/games/NewTiles1.2] is a Mahjongg-like tile matching game.  Uses simple shapes on the tiles instead of the more complex Mahjongg tiles.  Four levels of difficulty.
