## [[NewtonConnectivityCD]] R0.0.5

A project [suggested by DJ Vollkasko](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&m=111306156629839&w=2] on [[NewtonTalk]). This is a collection of tools needed on various platforms to connect the Newton to them, synch data, etc., to help to get the Newton more easily in touch with the world. The idea is that this collection of suggestions will be compiled as an archive of about 150 to 200 MB size, so it fits on a 3 in./8 cm Mini-CD and a CD image will be available as download.

* __Note:__ This project assumes that you already have all drivers and everything you need on your Newton installed + configured, and now suddenly have to cuddle up to some other computer and need specific drivers or tools to do this.

Please feel free to add and suggest anything that you think is missing in the "New suggestion"-section of the following
pages.
