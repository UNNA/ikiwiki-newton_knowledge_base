Unclassifiable Tips:

*_Tip:_ I bought some 5"x7" clear plastic picture frames at Walmart for under $2.00. If you lay them down and put the base at the top, you have an easy and cheap desk stand for your Newton. I like the angle it puts my Newton at for writing and they are cheap enough that I have one at home and one on my desk at work.

*_Tip:_ ChangeBatteryWarning level (NOS 2.x)
*_Tip:_ Hide the ButtonBar
