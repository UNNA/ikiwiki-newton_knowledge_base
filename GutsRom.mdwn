The MP2100 comes with 8MBytes of ROM, organized in 32bit width from address 0x00000000 to 0x00800000. There is still quite a lot of room left empty at the top of the address range (see GutsRex).

NewtonOS provides an interface that maps dynamic RAM over parts of the ROM using the MMU. This is great for repairing faulty ROM code or to set breakpoint in a debugger. There is also a large link table that is copied into RAM which can be used to intercept or redirect calls to the innermost functions of the ROM.

Very core developer friendly!

It should also be mentioned that the symbolic information for huge parts of the ROM is available in the "Cirrus ROM Image" that comes with the now free Newton developer environment. Information about the ROM image file format is available form ARM (now Intel).
