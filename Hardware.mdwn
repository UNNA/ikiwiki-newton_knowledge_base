There are 3 more orthodox ways to connect your Newton to the Internet.

* Ethernet

  For those who enjoy the absurd joys of Broadband internet access and run OS2, you'll be happy to know your Newt can join in too!

  Ethernet Cards are inexpensive thanks to the near market saturation of PCMCIA Ethernet Cards. For as little as $15 one of these babies - complete with dongle - can be yours. Most cards are easily supported by Drivers available for download from [chuma.org | http://www.chuma.org/newton/ethernet/] and the same site provides a comprehensive guide to setting up an ethernet Internet Configuration. In fact I'd call upon the author to go this particular paragraph and insert his description because most of the information on this subject is succinctly laid out on his site =]

* Modem

  Modem cards are also inexpensive and tend to be the favoured low-end approach. The 56k dialup is universally accepted in all countries on all terrestrial phone-lines, it  ''is'' civilization. All you need is a PCMCIA card from ebay and a driver. A lot of Generic modem cards run natively through Newton Internet Enabler (See the Software page) under the "28k or faster" choice and for a complete view of the Modem Cards that work with the Newton try Len Lutz's [big list 'o Newton PCMCIA Modem Cards | http://www.dca.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/lenlutz/newton.cgi] at some point I'll probably end up mirroring this resource in case it drops - as it is you can't add more information to the table. The drivers and modem scripts for many cards previously had a home at the DNUG domain but currently seem lost. If you haven't bought a card yet then I would reccomend checking the details out with the [Newtontalk | http://www.newtontalk.net] Mailing List to find out if the card you want works with your Newton.

* Wireless

  The cadillac of Internet Access, the Newton's shining point, blasting all other PDA's asunder with its mighty Wavelan drivers and Orinocco Wireless cards the Newton shows it is mighty in the realm of wireless internet access supporting the 802.11 or "Airport" internet standard. Ahem... If I knew how this stuff worked I'd write about it, as it is I'll leave it to a !WikiWiki'er who's actually qualified to help folks in this regard.. As it is I would reccomend a quick browse of the [Newton FAQ | http://www.splorp.com/newton/faq/] and see where you go from there.
