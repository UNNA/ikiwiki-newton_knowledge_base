  With this procedure,  you can change the default settings of the Conceptronic CBT100C PC Card and make it usable in a Newton with Blunt. <br>
<br>
  WARNING!!  This process can render your card useless,  don't do this if you don't feel confident,  ask before if you have any doubt.   Use this information at your own risk.<br><br>

 1.- Files needed: PSTool.exe  ,  Oxprom.exe  ,  complex.dat  , OXCF950 drivers.<br>
 2.- Insert the card in a windows laptop and install it with the OXCF950 drivers.<br>
 3.- Find the serial port it has created with the hardware manager.<br>
 4.- Launch PSTool and select that serial port, BCSP and 961kbps.<br>
 5.- Change the default view in "view", "ordinal sort".<br>
 6.- find key nr. 191 and change it to TBD.<br>
 7.- find key nr. 1f9 and change it to TBD.<br>
 8.- push "reset BC" button and exit PSTool.<br>

   With these operations,  you have changed the card's BT module default operating mode to one that the newton can use.  <br> Now, you have to change the operating mode of the card's serial port chip so the newton OS can actually talk to the BT module through it.<br>

 9.- Open a hyper Terminal sesion using the card's serial port and the default serial settings. <br>
 10.- Launch OXPROM select OXCF950 device, enter base address (it's the first number in I/O range, use device manager).<br>
 11.- write complex.dat in the file field and push program device.  It will take a few minutes.

  That's it!  You can use this card with the "generic" driver in Blunt.

  I'm taking screen-shots for the whole process.  They'll be here in a few days.
