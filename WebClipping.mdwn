A WebClipping application gathers data from various parts of the web for later perusal.  AvantGo is one well-known version of this for PDAs, but the capability has been in browsers such as [InternetExploder | http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp] for quite some time now.  IE calls this "Off-line Browsing".
