There are devices capable of converting a physical serial connection to a wireless connection.

Such devices can convert a serial connection to a wireless one using a RF component, a bluetooth or a 802.11b chip, with full protocol conversion.

Particularity of such devices is the "transparency" of the signals, which are recognized by more common Bluetooth/[[WiFi]]/RF receivers without matter.

Although the transparency of such communications, WEP is still available.

Any [[MessagePad]] can communicate through a [[SerialToWireless]] converter using default system serial link.

*'Blunt' is not required on [[SerialToBluetooth]] sync
*Some [[SerialToWiFi]] interfaces, fully configurable via AT commands, do not need the 'Wave LAN' driver

Take a look to the tested devices list on the [[SerialToWireless]] page.
