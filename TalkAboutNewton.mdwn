The NewtonMessagePad has a burgeoning online community.  Even before the rise of the Internet, Newton users congregated on Apple's old eWorld online service, and in special sections of AOL and CompuServe.

Nowadays, there are a great deal of online mailing lists and discussion groups you can join to talk to other Newton users!  Here's a list.

Mailing Lists
* [NewtonTalk|http://www.newtontalk.net/] - Probably the grandaddy of them all, NewtonTalk has been steaming along since at least 1995.  It still boasts around 1900 users (3/5/03), and is a __very__ active group, often topping 3000 posts a month.
