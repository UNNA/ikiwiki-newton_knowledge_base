!Installing packages via a memory card
Use another Newton to copy packages to the card, then place that card into the virgin Newton and move the package(s) onto it.%%%
If you don't have a second Newton yourself, or no Newton friend in your vicinity to help you, the CardLending Service offered by FrankGruendel (Germany) and PaulCurtis (USA) will help you. Against a refundable deposit fee they'll preload storage cards with all the packages you need to get connected and will send this to your doorstep.%%%
This is also useful if the display of your Newton is broken and you need to save all your data to your desktop via [DataRescue|http://www.stillnewt.org/library/_Software/NewtonConnectivityCD/Apple%20Newton%20Survival%20Tools/DataRescue%20(NOS%201.x,%202.x)] (NOS 1.x & 2.x, writen by André Meyer 1996), but don't have your own NewtonFirstAidCard.
