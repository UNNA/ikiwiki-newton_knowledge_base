Here's [my|EckhartKoeppen] setup... the most important use cases for my Newton are:

* My Newton is for most information I keep my main data storage, I like to have all important things in one place - synchronizing never works properly anyway
* It is my main address book
* It keeps all important notes
* I use it in a GtdSetup for tracking tasks and projects

And this is what I don't use my Newton for (that somehow implies that I also won't be working much on software in these areas):

* EMail: I just get too much email, and most of it also has attachments which I can't read on the Newton anyway.
* Web browsing: The Newton is not powerful enough for a true web browsing experience, mostly due to the limited amount of RAM. But things like JavaScript or SSL don't make things easier either.
* Entering calendar data: This is very similar to email, I'm using Outlook, and so do the people I work with, so the only way I use the Newton for calendar information is to have a snapshot of upcoming appointments
* True synchronizing with either a Mac or a PC. However, SyncML is something I have been looking into time and again, maybe I'll get around to doing something with it at some point!
* MP3 playback: Even though I implemented MadMax, I also have an iPod and listen usually to Internet radio.
