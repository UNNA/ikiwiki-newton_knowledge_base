### Who is the mystery boy?

%%%
Nobody knows, but then nobody really cares, either.%%%

I hate _kewl'' and __hip__ stuff. I ''love'' old crap and weird and odd things. I do things my way, and more often than not the result is, ehem, ''peculiar_. Not pretty. But who cares? So my setup is perhaps a bit rough and somewhat braindead if compared to the Newton-hotshots. Most fitting, considering the unique hardware I'm using...%%%

## Hardware
* [Dr. Gruendelstein [[MessagePad]] 2g00|] - a _veeeery_ rare beast!
* Mr. PCBMan's [Ser-001] internal serial adapter card (aka [[DongleKiller]])
* [Smitheroni Ethernet Card|]
* [[SphinxPicoCard]] - built-for-Newton [[BlueTooth]].
* [[AQ300]]
* Newton Keyboard
* Double-Gruendelized Apple [[MessagePad]] 130
* Couple large [[LinearFlashRamCards]] from Dr. Gruendelstein, brilliant for shlepping massive Newton ebooks around.

## Software%%%

* EBook Reader Tuning
** X-Newtbook
** HTMList

* Communication
** Blunt
** Neo
** IC/VC
** Obex

* Apps
** GPS Map

* Games
** [[WordSquare]] -- a real must-have!
** [[DeepGreen]]
** [[SpeedBump]]

* Extras tools
** [[SmallExtras]] by [[EckhartKoeppen]]--in theory a brilliant app, but somehow it didn't work for me, so I had to kick it off.

# Some [[WikiWikiNewt]]-Pages I've worked on
* [[DJVollkaskoSetup]]
* [[ChangeSystemSounds]]
* [[NewtonConnectivityCD]]
* [[GPSOnNewton]]
* [[BluntSetup]]
* [[MakeNewtonEbooksIndex]]
* [[NewtonWishLists]]--added stuff to both hardware and software wishlists. It would really be great if the Newton would see new, useful and original applications again, stuff that makes you want to get one just for the sake of this one app or tool...

# Some [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org)-Pages I've worked on
