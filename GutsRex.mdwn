The REx, ROM Extension, is a system that allows NewtonOS to find extension ROMs that may have been installed on the internal ROM PCB. NewtonOS checks for REx's by reading address 0x00800000 and comparing it to (? - oops, I forgot) and calculating a checksum. Drivers in those extensions are added to the system and activated on demand.
