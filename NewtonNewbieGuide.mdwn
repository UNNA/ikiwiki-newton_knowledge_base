#  The Newton Newbie Guide

(_This is still a work in progress_)


## Preamble

In recent years, there has been a large number of new users come to the Newton platform. Certainly more than one would expect from a platform that has been abandoned by its creator for almost 15 years now. These newbies have traditionally been pointed at the [FAQ](http://old.chuma.org/newton/faq/) or the [NewtonTalk mailing list](http://www.newtontalk.net/) for answers to their questions. But it finally dawned on us that it would be the best if there was one central clearinghouse for Newton newbie information. So here we are.


## Getting Started


###  __What is a Newton?__

See the [[Newton MessagePad|NewtonMessagePad]] node.  Newton is the original PDA. The Newton line of PDAs was launched by Apple Computer in 1993, and discontinued in 1998. You can get a [quick rundown of the released models](http://old.chuma.org/newton/faq/newton-faq-hardware.html#IIA). Basicially though, everyone has or wants an upgraded MessagePad 2000 or a MessagePad 2100. These were the latest models, the most feature-packed, and the ones that most new software is being developed for today.

To learn more about the lingo and jargon about the Newton, check out the [[Newton Glossary|NewtonGlossary]].


###  __Where do I get a Newton?  How much does it cost?__

Pretty much the only place to get one (assuming you don't know someone who has one stuffed in a desk drawer) is [eBay](http://www.ebay.com). Other possibilities are looking for ads or posting a Wanted ad to the comp.sys.newton.misc newsgroup, or the NewtonTalk mailing list.  There are also some resellers out there that sell through non-eBay channels - look them up in the [[Vendors List|VendorsList]].  For current going prices on Newtons and accessories, consult the [This Old Newt price guide](http://www.thisoldnewt.net/html/used.html) (_broken link_).


### __What hardware do I need to get started?__

(_Older models are not discussed here_)

For a MessagePad 2000 or 2100, at a minimum you need:

 * The Newton itself;
 * A battery tray (which you put AA batteries into, and then slot into the Newton) or a rechargable battery pack and AC adapter;
 * A stylus;
 * If you have a Macintosh [[PowerBook]] equipped with a Infrared port and running Mac OS 8.x or 9.x, you can connect to your Newton via [[IrDA]] to install software (see [[BootStrapping]]);
 * Otherwise, you will need a serial cable with a [[MiniDIN]]-8 connector for connecting to your PC or Mac, plus a Newton [[Dongle]] (this is an adapter which connects the serial cable to the Newton Interconnect Port under the door at the top of the Newton) or equivalent (See next section).


### __What kind of serial cable do I need?__

If you get a standard Newton serial cable, make sure that you also get a serial dongle — see the [[About Dongles|AboutDongles]] page.  This will mate the serial cable to the Newton's special Interconnect port, as stock MP 2x00 models didn't have a standard Mac serial connection like all MP 1x0 models do, which have the [[MiniDIN]] 8-serial port that was Apple's standard for connecting peripherals at the time (printers, keyboards, ...). There are also serial cables that have this Interconnect plug molded into one end.  There is also a third-party addon, the [[SER-001]] by [[Mr PCBMan]], that provides a 2x00 with a standard serial connector.  Note that all recent Macs since the iMac don't have serial ports anymore: you'll have to invest in a [[USB-to-Serial adapter|USBtoSerialAdapter]] (list of compatible models), or a [Stealth serial port](http://www.geethree.com/stealth/stealth.html).

You can avoid this and other [[BootStrapping]] issues by using the [[Card lending|CardLending]] services available from [[Frank Gruendel|FrankGruendel]] in [Europe](http://www.pda-soft.de) and in the USA by ???. They lend you a card preloaded with all packages you could possibly need to [[set up Bluetooth|UsingBluetoothIndex]] or configure Ethernet or [[Wifi]], thus avoiding any [[Dongle]] and serial cable issues.


###  __Where can I get manuals or other documentation?__

All of the manuals that came with Newtons are also available as PDF files.  They're all [here](http://www.unna.org/view.php?/apple/documentation/), sorted by model.


###  __What other hardware should I look for?__

* _Storage cards_.  The Newton supports linear flash cards for additional data storage.  However, these cards are becoming harder and harder to find as they have been largely replaced with ATA-style flash memory and other formats such as [[CompactFlash]] and [[SmartMedia]].  However, there is now an [ATA driver](http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/) for the Newton that will let you use these types of media (with an appropriate PCMCIA adapter).

* _Modems_.  Most PCMCIA hardware modems will work with the Newton - some may need a special configuration string.  Any "[WinModem](SoftModem)" or "[[SoftModem]]" will NOT work.  External serial modems will work fine as well.

* _Network cards_.  There is a [definitive list of working Ethernet cards](http://old.chuma.org/newton/ethernet/) and their drivers available.  It is also possible to use 802.11 "[[WaveLAN]]" wireless network cards with the Newton, with a [shareware driver](http://www.drvlabo.jp/old/eng/newtwave.htm). Of course Bluetooth is also [available](UsingBluetoothIndex).


###  __Where do I get software?__

The largest repository of Newton software is at [UNNA](http://www.unna.org/).  Since there is so much software there, you probably want to read some [[UNNA reviews|UnnaReviews]] to help you choose packages. For some example of what other [[Newtonian]]s use, see [[Cool setups|CoolSetups]]. Additional stuff can be found on many webpages, see the links at the bottom of the Wiki [[homepage|index]]. A lot of content — mainly ebooks — can be found at either [UNNA](http://www.unna.org/view.php?/books) or the [Temporary Newton Library](http://www.stillnewt.org/library), the only actively maintained Newton bookshelf at the moment (2005).


### __What software should I install?__

This is largely up to you.  Read [NewtonTalk](http://www.newtontalk.net/) and other online forums and ask for people's opinions.  You'll probably get a lot of ideas on what to try.  For most 2x00s, however, there are certain things that every Newton should have installed:

* Get the latest system patch for your model.  [Look up what you should have](http://old.chuma.org/newton/faq/newton-faq-nos.html#IIIA2), and then [go and get it](http://www.unna.org/view.php?/apple/software/SystemPatches).

* If you have an upgraded 2000, upgraded eMate, or 2100, a [[61Fix]] package to avoid the nasty [['61Error]].

* [[BigNotes]] to allow you to create notes larger than the default (small) size.

* Newton Works for word processing, spreadsheets, advanced drawing and more.  Get it [here](http://newyork.unna.org/unna/applications/NewtonWorks/).  To activate handwriting recognition in works, you'll also need [HWRWorks](http://www.unna.org/unna/applications/NewtonWorks/hwrworks/).

###  __How do I connect this thing to my desktop?__

See the pages for [[Mac OS connection|MacOSConnection]], [[Windows connection|WindowsConnection]], [[UNIX connection|UNIXConnection]], [[Bluetooth connection|UsingBluetoothIndex]].


### __How do I connect this thing to the Internet?__

Now that you've got this thing hooked up to your computer, you want to start surfing the web! You want to send and receive email! These things, and anything else you can do on the net can be done with a Newton. This is where you really see how well the Newton has adapted to "life after death". Internet access has been the yardstick upon which most Operating Systems have been measured in the past decade and beyond and the Newton outshines amongst its fellow PDA's for its support of most things net-related.


So let's start at the bare Basics:

 * [[Desktop connection hardware|DesktopConnectionHardware]]

 * [[Desktop connection software|DesktopConnectionSoftware]]

###  __What are some of the most popular packages on the Newton and what do they do?__

Here's a list for you, with links to their web pages (where applicable) or directory in [UNNA](http://www.unna.org):

* [Newt's Cape](http://communicrossings.com/html/newton/newtscape.htm) — Web browser / web clipping / book creator.

* [Avi's Backdrop](http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/AvisBackdrop/) (newer version available on [UNNA](http://www.unna.org/view.php?/applications/backdrops/AvisBackdrop)) — Custom backdrop application: displays background graphics, date/time, anniversaries, and more!

* _more_
