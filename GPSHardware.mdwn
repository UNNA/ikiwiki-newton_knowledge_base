** Used by Ron in his LakeTahoeHikingNewton setup.
*__[AQ-Max|http://www.aqmax.com] [AQ-300]-U-PS2 (GPS mouse)__
**SiRF Star II chipset, dual-channel communications via RS-232 or TTL, 12 channel, WAAS, RTMC/DGPS. Draws 35 mA -- GREEN (!!!) flashing LED when unit has position fix.

**Used by DJ Vollkasko with NewtNav on MessagePad2100 and with C3001 USB-to-serial bridge cable (Prolific PL-2303 chipset) on Apple G4 Powerbook.
* __NewtNav__ (Adriano Angelillis' brilliant Newton-to-GPS Adapter)
** Connects GPS mice to Newton's serial port and powers them, too!
* __Haicom HI-303E (low-power CF Card)__
**[Image by Dr. Michael Briley|http://www.phys.uwosh.edu/mike/newt-gps.jpg]
** 12 channel, WAAS capable, approx US$ 85 (www.storagemedia.com),-- (with adapters + cables), needs ~US$ 12 CF adapter to fit the Newton. Comes with DB-9, USB, and firewire cables for use as a GPS mouse as well as a CF Card.  Power consumption rated at 120mA.  Typical use:  Newton powered on, GPS running continuous: 138mA total draw.  Plus backlight, 175mA total draw.  A bluetooth "slipper" is also available ($74) which lets this GPS device be a solution for anything with a serial port or PCMCIA slot, or Bluetooth.
** Used by [Brian McEwen|http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&m=108680916800770&w=2]. Maybe also by Doug Parker.
** Used by [Michael Briley|http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&m=107272416923766&w=2] (of [Making Newton GPSMaps|http://www.phys.uwosh.edu/mike/newt-maps.html]-fame), who also posted above picture of it in use and confirms it works nicely in his G4 Titanium PowerBook (hmh, definitely a pro for this solution...!).
* __Haicom HI-303S (CF Card, newer model)__
** 12 channel, WAAS capable, US$ 110 to 150,--, needs ~US$ 12 CF adapter.   Can also be used as a GPS Mouse (cables supplied as with the 303E? should be, not known for sure).
* __Centennial SatNav GPS Card (PCMCIA Card)__
** Works with GPS Map 1.8.5, GPS Map Lite  1.2.5 or later (NOS 2.x only!) with [special SatNav driver|http://www.unna.org/view.php?/applications/GPSMap2.1] by Gerd Staudenmaier.
