__MP 1x0 Turbo Board__


__What:__ Boost MP 120 and 130 beyond recognition. ;=}

__Background:__ "Of course I'd rally for a 450 MHz CPU-option for the MP 1x0 and a fat 64 MB RAM upgrade there,
plus throwing a board for MP 2x000 ROMs-inna-1x0 case into the mix for NOS 2.1 and Works, but I don't think there's any chance. Would be more than nice, though, to get NOS 2.1 and high performance in a 1x0 form factor."

__Benefit:__ Heavy-hitting PDA with nicer form factor than MP 2x00 and much more oomph.
