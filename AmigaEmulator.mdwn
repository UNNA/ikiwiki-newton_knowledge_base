This week an Amiga emulator came to PocketPC, and we still don't have one! Arrgh! ;=}

There are several emulators for desktop computers freely available, e.g. [UAE Amiga Emulator|http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/], which is all GPL and has ports to DOS, Windows 95/NT, MacOS, RiscOS, BeOS and NextStep. Another one is [Fellow|http://sourceforge.net/projects/fellow/], which supposedly is faster but possibly doesn't emulate the Amiga hardware as completely as UAE.

Now Ismail Khatib [ported UAE to PocketPC|http://pocketinsanity.sourceforge.net/index.php?content=uae] (check out the screenshots!).

I wish for an Amiga emulator for Newton, so we could use all the cool Amiga apps 'n' games on our green buddies!
