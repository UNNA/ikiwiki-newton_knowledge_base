The REx, ROM Extension, is a system that allows [[NewtonOS]] to find extension ROMs that may have been installed on the internal ROM PCB. [[NewtonOS]] checks for REx's by reading address 0x00800000 and comparing it to (? - oops, I forgot) and calculating a checksum. Drivers in those extensions are added to the system and activated on demand.
