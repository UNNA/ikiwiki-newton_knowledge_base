OS X native software is under development by some sources. Apple has never released any Mac OS X native software or UNIX software for the Newton. All OS X software is being developed by Third Parties.

## Hardware

The Newton has the following methods of connecting to other computers or the Internet:

* Serial Port, via the [[InterConnectPort]] and an [[InterConnectDongle]]
* ![[InfraRed]] Port
* Ethernet via PCMCIA card (PCCard) (*)
* Wireless Ethernet (WI-FI) via PCMCIA card (*)
* Modem via PCMCIA card or Serial Port (*)

(The * means that using this method requires software to be installed on the Newton.)

__Package transfers to a Completely Reset Newton:__

A Newton has the following connections supported after a complete [[BrainWipe]]:

* Serial Ports: Since most OS X capable machines lack serial ports, you will have to invest in a USB to Serial adapter to use this hardware. You will also need an [[InterConnectDongle]].
* [[IrDA]]: use an ![[InfraRed]] ([[IrDA]]) capable Powerbook, or use a USB to [[IrDA]] adapter on a Mac without built-in [[IrDA]] (you won't be able to use any native [[MacOS]] X application for that transfer and you might actually need to reboot on [[MacOS]] 9 to use Jerome Vernet's [[IrDAPackageInstaller]]).
* PCMCIA Linear Flash Card: From someone in the Newton community, get a Linear Flash Card that has the additional drivers and software you need. You will want to transfer the driver packages and probably the [[NewtonInternetEnabler]] (NIE) pkgs. People on the ![[NewtonTalk]] list are willing to do this for the cost of shipping.

__Package transfers to a Newton that has additional drivers on it:__

Use the methods listed above or use [[EtherNet]] or [[AirPort]]. To use [[EtherNet]], remember that you have to install [[EtherNet]] drivers on the Newton first, if they aren't already there. To use an Internet connection to transfer packages (Via e-mail or via a Web Browser) you will also need the [[NewtonInternetEnabler]] (NIE) pkgs.

## Package Transfer Software

# In Classic
* [[NewtonConnectionUtilities]] (From Apple)
* [[NewtonBackupUtility]] (From Apple)
* [[NewtonPackageInstaller]] (From Apple)

All of the above run under OS X, but in Classic mode. You must have Classic installed, and both OS X and Classic configured to use [[AppleTalk]] properly.

# Native
There are also some OS X native package installation utils:

* [NewTen](http://www.panic.com/~stevenf/index.php?node=NewTen) is a serial-only package installer.
* [PkgInstall-OSX|http://anrp.irulethe.net/newton/] is a TCP/IP based package installer, that uses the TCP/IP Dock transport from the [DILTester](http://www.tempel.org/newton/#DILplugin). Note: The transport must be installed on the Newton before this can be used. This software supports Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections. It is run from the Command Line (Terminal)  (*)
* [Delivery|http://www.kallisys.com/newton/dcl/] is a [[DesktopConnectionLibrary]]-based TCP/IP, Rendezvous and [[AppleTalk]] package installer (uses [DILTester](http://www.tempel.org/newton/#DILplugin) Dock transport or the provided TCP/IP Dock Transport)
* E-mail with Enroute or ![[SimpleMail]] over Ethernet or Wi-Fi (*)
* Via Web using [[NetHopper]] or [[NewtsCape]] or [[LunaSuite]] over Ethernet or Wi-Fi (*)

(The * means that this method requires software to be installed on the Newton.)

## Information Synchronization Software

Known OS X native connection/synchronization utils:

* [[NewtSync]] is a OS X Jaguar (10.2+) sync tool that boasts a plugin-style architecture.  It currently supports syncing Dates and Names from the Newton, and looks very promising.  It is capable of using both Serial and TCP/IP connections. There are also some additional 3rd-party plugins for [[NewtSync]] that lets you sync todos, notes, and other things.
* [Escale](http://www.kallisys.com/newton/dcl/] is another [[DesktopConnectionLibrary])-based application. It provides Package Installation, Keyboard use and Synchronization.
* [NCX](http://homepage.mac.com/simonbell/connection/) is a rewrite of the Newton Connection Utilities for OS X.  Created by Simon Bell, it is currently capable of backups and package installation with the ultimate goal of full data synchronization.
* [[AbiWord]] is an open source multiplatform word processor that reads and write Word, [[WordPerfect]], rtf, html, etc. Providing Newton-plugins for the desktop app could improve exchangeability of Newton-generated data with Windows/Unix/Linux/[[MacOSX]]-users of [[AbiWord]]. / Porting a slimmed down [[AbiWord]] to [[NewtonOS]] would teach the Newton all these formats and make exchange of documents with Windows/Unix/Linux/[[MacOSX]]-users of any word processor a snap.

(The * means that this method requires software to be installed on the Newton.)
