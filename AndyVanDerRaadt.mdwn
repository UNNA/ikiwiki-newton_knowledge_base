[[AndyVanDerRaadt]] is new to the Newton, though he used to play with the [[OriginalMessagePad]] his father had when he was a youngling. Presently he has that same H1000 and two [[MessagePad2100]]s, both wired and wireless.

He's looking for a spare dongle adapter, another AA battery tray and a keyboard of the Newton or Palm variety. If anyone is willing to part with one, [please get in touch](mailto:fallow@gmail.com).

He also owns a Palm m500; please forgive him. (It's in a drawer, somewhere.)
