The Desktop Connection Library is an open source, multi-platform library to connect to a Newton running [[NewtonOS]] 2.0 and exchange data with it. It replaces Apple's Desktop Integration Libraries (used in third party application that connect to the Newton through the Dock, such as [DILTester](http://www.tempel.org/newton/#DILplugin], [[NewtonBackupExpress]], and a light version of the framework used by Apple in their connection utilities such as [[NewtonConnectionUtilities]], [[NewtonPress]], [[NewtonPackageInstaller]), etc.).

The project was started in 2000 and is hosted on [Kallisys](http://www.kallisys.com/newton/dcl/) website.
