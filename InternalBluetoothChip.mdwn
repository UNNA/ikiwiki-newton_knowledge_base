__Internal Bluetooth Chip__


__What:__ Internal Bluetooth chip for MP 2x00 and eMate (if possible also MP 120, 130).

__Background:__ Implant Newtons with Bluetooth-capability by tying a BT-chip to either one of the three (four?) serial ports internally available or one of the four PC Card ports provided by the Voyager Chipset ([here | http://web.archive.org/web/19980111224604/http://www.cirrus.com/news/archive/fy1997/96.1028p.voyager.html]). High level of integration with other hardware hacks desireable (e.g. modifying the original Mr. PCBMAN(tm) SER001(tm) to a "BlueSER001(tm)" card), but for MP 1x0, standalone solutions appreciated, too. Groundwork in the driver-department already covered by Eckhart Köppen's [Blunt | http://www.40hz.org/Blunt], successful proof-of-concept, too ([here | http://40hz.org/mottek/archives/2004_01.html] and later).  Also see the [bt-001].

__Benefit:__ Bump all MP 2x00 (and others, hopefully) up to a 21st century IR-communication replacement, connect to keyboards, mobile phones and desktops without cables and much hustle. Would leave serial port (Interconnect or SER001) and PC Card slots undisturbed.

__Additional Data:__ Could possibly be integrated with either AppleMultifunctionInterconnectAdapter or InternalCommCard project.


__Any Takers?__%%%
%%%possibly, do you want mutliport bluetooth, ie, several different devices connected at once, or just the ability to link up to an additional device (phone, computer, etc)?
