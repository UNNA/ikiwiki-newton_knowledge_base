These links take you to places where you can learn what you need to get started developing for the Newton - what SDKs are available, any tips and tricks, where you can find samples of code and help.

* [[NewtonErrorCodes]] -- A full listing of the NOS errors.

* [[NewtonScript]] -- get quickly started with your development project! Note: You can even use [[NewtonScript]] in [[NewtonBooks]] if working with [[BookMaker]] and [[NewtonToolKit]].

* [[MakotoNukui]] (aka [GNUE|mailto:gnue@so-kukan.com]) has released [NEWT/0|http://www.so-kukan.com/gnue/archives/2005/03/newt0_009_20050.html] (or look for the much more current [SVN|http://trac.so-kukan.com/newt/] archive), an open source [[NewtonScript]] compiler and interpreter for [[MacOS]] X, Linux and Windows. (Source: [Paul Guyot](http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk&m=111055258718841&w=2) 2005)

* [C++] for Newton

* [[DevelopingWabaApplications]] (see also [[WabaApplications]])

* Some nice articles can be found at [PDA Lifestyle|http://www.pda-lifestyle.de/beitraege/newton] (sorry, German only): [Become a developer in 7 steps|http://www.pda-lifestyle.de/beitraege/newton/7steps/] (NSBasic, Newt, NTK, C++), [NewtonScript-tutorial|http://www.pda-lifestyle.de/beitraege/newton/progtut], [Object-oriented Programming and NewtonScript|http://www.pda-lifestyle.de/beitraege/newton/objekte/], [Prefs for own projects](http://www.pda-lifestyle.de/beitraege/newton/codefrag/prefs/).

* There has also been at least one [course project](http://metcs.bu.edu/~feneric/cs331/Archives/Project2002/) related to developing Newton Books.

* [[OtherProgrammingLanguages]]

* [[NewtonGuts]] -- Very intimate details about CPU, RAM, ROM, ASIC, Interrrupts and more

* [[InspectorProtocol]] - how the NTK Inspector and the Newton communicate
