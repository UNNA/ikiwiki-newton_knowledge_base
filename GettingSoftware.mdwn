## Getting Software

So you've gone out and bought a new Newton, you've solved the [[BootStrapping]] problem but don't know what to do next?  Well the answer is simple,  [UNNA ](http://www.unna.org/) is the biggest source of Newton software around. If you have a pre-OS 2.1 Newton (e.g. not an eMate, Newton 2000 or Newton 2100,) you'll probably want to do a search of the database for compatable software, but you've got to remember not all software is yet in the database.  If you install a package not yet in the database __please__ add a description.
