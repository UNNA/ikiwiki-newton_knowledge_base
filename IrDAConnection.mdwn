The MessagePad 2000, 2100, and the eMate all have IrDA compatible infrared ports.  Using this and some additional software you can send files from any PC, Mac, PalmOS device, or even cell phone that supports the IrOBEX protocol.

To use this on the Newton, you must first install the Neo, Nitro, and IC/VC packages available at [http://40hz.org/].

Then you can beam PKG files or any other file to the Newton by:

; __Windows 2000/XP__ : Run 'irftp' from the Start->Run... box, browse to the file you want to send but don't send it yet!  Line up the Newton's IR port with the PC.  Open the In/Out box on the Newton and tap 'Recieve -> IrOBEX'.  In a second you should get a notification in the taskbar on the PC that it has detected the IR connection.  __NOW__ click Send on the PC and the file will be sent.
* Note: When using Windows XP, if you open the In/Out box, and click "receive", then line up the IR ports the Wireless Connection dialog box should automatically open (no need to run 'irftp')

 If you have an IrDA-capable Macintosh computer (most older PowerBooks and some iMacs) running MacOS 9.x, you can use JeromeVernet's software [IrDAPackageInstaller].

__How to beam stuff between Newtons__

What is required? What are the steps? What additional packages improve the beaming-experience?


* Beam stuff between MP 1x0 and older

* Beam stuff between MP 2x00 or eMates ([NewtonOS2.1])

* Beam stuff between MP 1x0 and NOS 2.1-Newtons

[Connect to iMac or PowerBook via Sloup|http://mywebpages.comcast.net/saweyer/newton/sloup/connect.htm#IrDA] - thanks, Bill Moser!

[Connect to iMac via EETransfer|http://web.ukonline.co.uk/kieran.miller/newton/irda.html] - Cheers, Bill & Kieran! Now whole files can be exchanged. Note: "Both the Keyspan Serial adaptor and Griffin iPort card will disable the IR software when they're in use, so make sure you unplug them before trying the IrDA connection."

[Infrared and IrDA connections in Palmtops and Computers|http://www.ericlindsay.com/computer/irda.htm] - general background on Ir-technology, pretty good stuff. Short chapter "InfraRed and [IrDA] drivers for Apple Newton" - could use some updating. Anybody knowlegeable pls. contact webmaster@ericlindsay.com (who is Australian and has a [MP 110 review online|http://www.ericlindsay.com/palmtop/new110.htm]!)
