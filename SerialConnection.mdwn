''__Newton Serial Docking__''

*Take a serial cable for Mac (MiniDIN-8 to MiniDIN-8) or Windows PC (MiniDIN-8 to DB9)
*Connect physically your MessagePad to your desktop serial port (or to a RS-232 to USB adapter) using the above mentioned cable
*Open your desktop-to-Newton data exchange/sync application
*Open the 'Dock' application on your MessagePad
*On the tab "Connect via" choose the "Serial' option
*Click "Connect"
*As you will see the new window appear, your experience with the MessagePad will grow-up quickly
%%%''Some notes:''
%%% - connecting via "Serial" will let your desktop  communicate with your MessagePad at a 'fixed speed' of 38,400bps
%%% - at 'fixed speed' a 4MB data transfer can last 20 minutes
%%% - a faster serial connectivity could be enabled on Mac OS computers with OS9 and/or OSX installed, with or without serial ports,
%%% - the Mac OS is ready to carry data through the serial ports at the speed of 230,400bps.
%%% - serial speed can be clocked to 2,000,000bps via additional equipment (external 'hardware' clocking - slightly used in industries).
%%% - a 'software' clocking example in Mac OS was/is available upon AppleTalk connectivity: old Apple printers communications speed worked over 700,000bps
%%% - a report about a stable 230,000bps Newton serial docking is available [here | http://tools.unna.org/wikiwikinewt/index.php/230KSerialConnection].
%%% - WinPC serial communications can reach the speed of 115,200bps
