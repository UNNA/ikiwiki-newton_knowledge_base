[[InkText]] is a [[HandWritingRecognition]] setting where "raw" handwriting is saved as a series of 'images' in a Newton Note. Since the recognizer does not attempt to convert your writing into text, writing can be sped up considerably. For this reason some users prefer to use [[InkText]] for data entry, and have the recognizer convert the text for them later.
