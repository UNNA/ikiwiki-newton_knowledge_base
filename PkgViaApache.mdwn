This should be pretty simple. All it would need to be is an Applescript and/or a shell script that would:

Add the proper MIME type to the "mime.types" file:

You can find this in:

        "/private/etc/httpd/mime.types"

Add the line:

        "application/x-newton-compatible-pkg pkg"

The script would:

# set a string called NewtMime to "application/x-newton-compatible-pkg pkg"
# set a string called PkgExt to "pkg"
# get Administrator permissions
# if grep the mime.types file for the existence of NewtMime then exit
# if grep the mime.types file for the existence of PkgExt then ask which one to replace or new line
# overwrite chosen existing line, or append NewtMime to the end of the file
# restart apache
