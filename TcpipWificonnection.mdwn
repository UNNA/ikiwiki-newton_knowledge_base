From an NTLK post by Simon Stapelton:%%%

Here's my setup, which uses a direct tcp airport connection, rather than appletalk, and seems to work rather well. %%%

''Powerbook''%%%
The powerbook is set up to provide a computer-computer network. %%%
Powerbook's IP on airport is 192.168.1.3, %%%
subnet mask 255.255.255.0, %%%
router 192.168.1.3 (machine routes ip using brickwall). %%%
Appletalk is off on airport. %%%
'by default join' is set to automatic. %%%

''Newton''%%%
Newt has Paul's TCP/IP [dock module |http://www.kallisys.com/newton/dcl/en] installed. %%%
Worksite wavelan setup in infrastructure mode, no WEP, no roaming, no power management. %%%
Worksite internet setup uses manual configuration using the wavelan card, subnet 255.255.255.0, ip 192.168.1.64, gateway 192.168.1.3, dns
and domain as per my ISP. %%%

When I insert the card in the newt, I uncheck 'use for appletalk' %%%

Dock setup as follows: manual settings, connect to 192.168.1.3 port 3679. I could probably zeroconf here, but I've not been able to find the magic incantation to make that work. %%%


It's rare that the connection times out.
