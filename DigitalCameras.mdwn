!Tibet-Compatible Cameras

* "The following digital cameras will work with a MP2k and Tibet software provided that you have the proper serial cable to connect to the Newton (i.e., a serial cable to connect to macintoshes):
**Agfa ePhoto 307
**Agfa ePhoto 780
**Agfa ePhoto 780c *
**Agfa ePhoto 1280
**Agfa 1680
**Fuji
**Nikon CoolPix 800
**Nikon CoolPix 900
**Nikon CoolPix 950
**Olympus D-300L
**Olympus D-320L
**Olympus D-340R
**Olympus D-360L
**Olympus D-450Z
**Olympus Camedia C-400
**Olympus Camedia C800L (that's what it is called in Europe, the US designation is different)
**Olympus C-1000 L
**Epson PhotoPC 700
**Sanyo VPC-X350

*Neal Sofge NealS@aol.com reports:
**I have an Agfa ePhoto 780c, which is apparently an updated version of the 780 in an iMac-compatible blue case. It works with Tibet, but only if you "distract" the camera by sliding the lens cover open and closed while trying to communicate with it. The timing on this is tricky, but you can get good at it after enough practice.

*It seems some cameras are compatible with the Fujitsu chipset. (which the Olympus have inside)

*The following cameras will not work:
**QuickTakes
**Kodaks
**Connectix QuickCams
**Canon cameras were once reported as compatible, but Daniel Padilla dpadill@clientes.unicaja.es said they don't. At least his PowerShot 350 doesn't. ( http://www.average.org/digicam/)

*Daniel Padilla also reported that to work with Tibet Software, a camera needs to have the Sierra imaging firmware and a serial port. Look at http://www.sierraimaging.com/support/supchimgex.html for a list of supported cameras." ([Newton FAQ, March 2003|http://www.chuma.org/newton/faq/newton-faq-hardware.html#IIB9])

*Instructions for making your own serial cable for the Olympus D360L are located at [http://homepage.mac.com/mguzzo/newton/d360Lhack.html]
