## Desktop connection hardware

There are 3 more orthodox ways to connect your Newton to the Internet.


### Ethernet

For those who enjoy the absurd joys of Broadband Internet access and run OS 2.x, you'll be happy to know your Newt can join in too!  See related [[WiFi]] and [[EtherNet]] pages for guidelines on which cards are available to work with your Newt.


### Modem

Modem cards are also inexpensive and tend to be the favoured low-end approach. The 56k dialup is universally accepted in all countries on all terrestrial phone-lines, it  _is_ civilization. All you need is a PCMCIA card and a driver. A lot of Generic modem cards run natively through Newton Internet Enabler (See the [[Desktop connection software|DesktopConnectionSoftware]] page) under the "28k or faster" choice and for a complete view of the Modem Cards that work with the Newton try Len Lutz's [big list o' Newton PCMCIA Modem Cards](http://www.dca.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/lenlutz/newton.cgi).  See [[ModemCards]] for more in-depth information about picking a modem card.


### Wireless

The Cadillac of Internet Access, the Newton's shining point, blasting all other PDA's asunder with its mighty [[WaveLan]] drivers the Newton shows it is mighty in the realm of wireless Internet access supporting the 802.11 or "Airport" internet standard. Ahem... Maybe a quick trip to the [[WiFi]] page is in order.
