[[LocalTalk]] is [[Apple]]'s name for [[AppleTalk]] protocol running on an ad-hoc RS-422 serial-bus network.  Speed is limited to some 200kbps, but the Newton actually does [[LocalTalk]] at 57600 bauds.

[[LocalTalk]]'s inital use was to connect and network to expensive laser printers.  It quickly found other uses, from file sharing onwards.

Old Mac hands will remember when [[AppleTalk]] meant both the protocol and the hardware it ran on.  One early plug-compatible was Farralon's [[PhoneTalk]] hardware which used inexpensive telephone wiring to pass the signals around.
