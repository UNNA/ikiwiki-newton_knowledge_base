The NotePad is where many Newton users do most of their work. Much like an ordinary paper notebook, a Newton NotePad may contain text, graphics, or both. You can use the HandWritingRecognition, save your scribbles as InkText, or draw an amusing doodle.
The NotePad is the default BackDrop application of a stock Newton.
