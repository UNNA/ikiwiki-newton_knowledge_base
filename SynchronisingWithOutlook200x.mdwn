This procedure is for a serial connection.  I have never used the email method of data transfer between a PC and a Newton.

1.  Download LookOut 1.1 from UNNA

2.  Install it.

3.  Do a Google search for a freeware utility called ClickYes; download the utility and install it.  The utility stops Outlook's security routines from preventing you tampering with its databases.

4.  Run NCU and install the Lookout package on your Newton.  I think it has to be a MP2x00.

5.  Run LookOut on the PC and set the serial port to 1 and baud rate to 38400 (that's the speed that worked for me).

6.  Click the first time synchronisation button on the PC session of LookOut.

7.  Tap the Lookout icon on the Newton

8.  Tap the prepare for first time synchronisation button on the Newton

9.  When the PC is ready it will provide a message saying it is waiting for the Newton

10.  When the Newton is ready it will have a screen that has a button on it saying something like "ready to connect".  Be patient this could be quite a while.

11.  Tap the "ready to connect" and wait for the machines to send information back and forth.  Again, be patient this could be quite a while.

12.  When the PC is finished you will be returned to the home application screen.

13.  When the Newton is finished it will give you a page with a summary of changes.  Close the page and you will be returned to the home application screen.

14.  Close the applications on both machines, you have finished.

__Always backup the Look Database on the PC when you have finished. If this file gets corrupted (and it does) you'll need a backup to restore functionality. I suggest a backup of the entire Lookout installation in the C:/Program Files/Seamless Software/ folder, just to be sure.__
