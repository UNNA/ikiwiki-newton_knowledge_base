!!Newton Hardware Wishlist

!Internal
* [Larger Factory Ram | InternalRamAddition] - Paul.Curtis@NewtonMP.com
* [MP 2x00 RAM Upgrade | MpRamUpgrade]
* [MP 1x0 Turbo-Board | MP1x0Turbo] - Power to the people!
* [MP 2x00 CPU Upgrade | MpCpuUpgrade]
* [eMate CPU Upgrade | eMateCpuUpgrade]
* BackupCapacitor for eMate - 1x0 have backup-batts, 2x00 a super-cap so removing the battery doesn't let them lose time and date. eMates don't have either...

* TFT screen - Oh man! A sharp black interface over a bright white background is all good or what? And so can we dream with a colorful NOS later?...

!Communication and Interfaces
* [eMateKeyboardIllumination] - adding strategically placed LEDs inside the eMate so that when the backlight is turned on, the keyboard is also lit.  I might actually end up doing this... - VictorRehorst

* Slimmer eMates and such, in other words: [eMate casemods | ecasemodlist]
* UniversalRemoteControlFunction
* InternalUSBInterface - An internal mini-USB interface card that installs like the SER-001 board
