Assuming you have a Mac with a working internet connection, and a Newton with a working Bluetooth card, your Mac can "share" the internet connection to the Newton, via Bluetooth.

Why is this neat?  Well, for example, I usually keep my Bluetooth card in my Newton, but used to have to swap it out for a [[WiFi]] card if I wanted to connect the Newt to the internet.  Also, the [[WiFi]] card uses WAY more battery power than the Bluetooth card.  Now, if I'm within 30 feet of my Mac, I can get my Newton online with a nice low power Bluetooth connection.

Unfortunately, setting it up is a bit complex.

It is assumed that you already have worked out the kinks in your Newton Bluetooth setup.  You should be paired with the Mac, and have done a service discovery.  Make sure you select the Mac's Serial Port service in the Newton's Bluetooth Setup  (there was only one in my case).  You'll also need a working NIE installation, and Eckhart Koeppen's modified NIE serial package that can use the Bluetooth connection as a serial port.

Next, you'll need to go to Terminal on the Mac, and carefully enter these commands.

- sudo /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

- sudo /usr/sbin/natd -interface en1 -use_sockets -same_ports -dynamic -clamp_mss

(Note the "en1" here.  If your Mac is connected to the internet using [[AirPort]], use en1.  If it's connected using Ethernet, use en0 here instead.)

- sudo /sbin/ipfw add divert natd ip from any to any via en1

(Same deal with the "en1" here.)

- sudo named

- sudo named

(I'm not sure this has to be done twice.  One site I was reading suggested it.)

- sudo /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/tty.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync 230400 noauth local
passive proxyarp asyncmap 0 silent persist :10.0.1.111

This starts a PPP server on the Bluetooth-PDA-Sync serial port.  Note the IP address here.  I've used 10.0.1.111.  This will be the address assigned to your Newton.

This can be anything you like, but it should be a valid IP address for your LAN.  If you use, for example, 192.168 addressing, you should use a 192.168.0.x address instead.  Make sure it's not an address that's in use by something else!

Now, you need to set up an internet connection on the Newton side!  Whew!

Create a new Internet Setup called whatever you like.

- Protocol: PPP
- Configuration: Manual
- User ID: <none>
- When closing, disconnect: <your preference>
- Local IP Address: (whatever IP address you used in the pppd command above!)
- Gateway/Router Address: (the IP address of the machine that's sharing its connection -- in my case, the Mac.  NOT the address of your actual router!)
- Primary DNS: <an actual working DNS address> (Using 0.0.0.0 doesn't seem to cut it.)
- Secondary DNS: <optional, up to you>
- Domain Name: <none>

Now, cross your fingers, and initiate a network connection from the Newton.  With a little luck, it should connect to the PPP server running on your Mac, and get online.

When you are all done, and you want to turn off the internet sharing on the Mac, try the following commands:

- sudo killall pppd
- sudo killall named
- sudo /sbin/ipfw -f flush
- sudo killall natd
- sudo /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0

A FEW NOTES:

- I've only tried this on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger

- At one point I went into the Bluetooth system preferences pane, Sharing tab, and changed the Bluetooth-PDA-Sync serial port from "Modem" to "RS-232".  I'm not sure if this is required, but it's something to try if it doesn't work for you.

- Because this runs a PPP server on the Bluetooth-PDA-Sync port, it will conflict with anything else that tries to use that port, such as Palm [[HotSync]].
