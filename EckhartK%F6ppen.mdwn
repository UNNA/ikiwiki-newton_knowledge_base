Eckhart is the developer of many useful Newton packages, such as The Fish ([NotePad] encryption), [Courier] (text-based webbrowser) and [MAD Newton] (MAD-based MP3 decoder for Newton). He is best known for his work on Newton communication interfaces with  [Nitro] (which brings the IrCOMM Communications Protocol to Newton) and most of all Blunt, the Newton [Bluetooth] driver. As of Spring 2006, a major redesign of the [Bluetooth] driver is underway (Blunt 2).

His software is open source (GPL- or LGPL-licensed) and available with source code from his website 40Hz.org.
