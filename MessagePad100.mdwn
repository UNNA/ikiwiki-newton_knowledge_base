The MessagePad100. I don't have anything useful to say, rather than: I actually saw one a few years ago. Pictures really do make the thing look smaller...

"The MP100 was the first Newton I ever owned. I didn't purchase it until 2003, but I fell in love with it very quickly. Pretty soon I had purchased an MessagePad120, MessagePad2000 (upgraded), and two eMates. Of these, I still use the MP100 the most. I __wish__ Apple had used AA batteries, but other than that it works great for me. It is small enough to be easily portable, and fast enough for basic notetaking. I really need to get some software on it though..."
