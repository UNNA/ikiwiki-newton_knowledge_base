__What:__ Excellent and inexpensive starter models are MessagePad 120 (w/o backlight, 1 PC Card slot, NOS 2.0 - older OS upgradeable) and 130 (backlight, 1 PC Card slot, NOS 2.0). The eMate is appreciated for its integrated keyboard - basically it's an ancestor of the iBooks.
The top of the line are MP 2000 and especially the last model, MP 2100 (backlight, 2 PC Card slots, 162 MHz StrongARM CPU, Voyager Chipset, NOS 2.1).

__How Much:__ See [Rich Lindsay|http://www.thisoldnewt.net/index2.html]'s excellent and strongly recommended [Newton Used Price Guide|http://www.thisoldnewt.net/html/used.html] for pricing information.%%%
Checked it on 10/20/05 and both links don't work.

__Where:__ There are several ways to get your own Newton. Besides checking local classified ads or Apple boards (or - in the US - school sales, thrift shops and flea markets), there is always [Ebay | http://www.ebay.com].

Some mailorders also sell Newtons, such as [J&K Sales, Inc. | http://www.jksalesinc.com/catalog/] (who also offer [PCBMan| http://mrpcbman.tripod.com]'s [SER001 board|http://jksalesinc.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=272] and installation of this) or [GEM Enterprises | http://www.gementerprises.com].

A few Newtonians also occasionally have Newtons on offer, e.g. [Frank Gruendel|http://www.pda-soft.de/] in Germany. Also it may be worth to check NewtonTalk for current sales offers.%%%
