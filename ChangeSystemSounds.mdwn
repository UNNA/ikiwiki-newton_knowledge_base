### Blingy Sounds

How to customize your [[Newton]]'s sounds for...
*Alarms (System Sound)
*Alerts (System Sound)
*Startup (System Sound)
*Sleep (System Sound)
*Package Added
*Package Removed
*Package Moved
*Package Replaced

* Note: This is kinda the audio pendant to [[StephanieMaks]]' Blinky Lights Hacks for [eMate|http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/otheremate.html] and [MP2x00](http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/othermp2100.html), only it helps to make the Newton infinitely more annoying to third parties by talking back about every single action... ;=}
* Recommendation: Set up all the acoustic monstrosities mentioned below, add [ScratchPad 2.0|http://www.stillnewt.org/library/_Software/_Audio] and mp3-player [Mad Max](http://40hz.org/MADNewton),improve your Newton with a batch of blinking lights, and hotglue a mirrorball to your nose. Then you'd be the first kid on your block to have a truly portable disco 'puting experience! (Offer vary while supplies last. Your mileage may good.)

*__A.__ You can set these with on-board means:%%%
**__Alarm Sound__ in Unfiled Icons/Prefs/Alarm%%%
**__Alert Sound__ in Unfiled Icons/Prefs/Sound%%%
*__B.1__ You can use __Sunrise 1.0__ by [Ray Rischpater](http://www.livejournal.com/users/kf6gpe], which allows to set sounds for __Startup__ and __Sleep__. It installs in [[Preferences]) (Prefs/Sunrise).%%%
** Download available [here|http://www.stillnewt.org/library/_Software/_Audio/] and [there](http://download.planetnewton.com/download/Util/Security20.htm).%%%
*__B.2__ Or you can use __[StartupSound 0.15 for NOS 2.x|http://tmurai-web.hp.infoseek.co.jp/computers/freeware/newton/ssound/startupsound.html]__ by [Tomoyoshi Murai](mailto:tmurai@mars.dtinet.or.jp)
*__C.__ [[Tactile]]'s __[Package Beeper](http://www.tactile.com/packageBeeper.html)__ goes bling after a package has installed, been moved, replaced or deleted.%%%
**It accepts any new sounds you've installed and gives you the option to set individualised acoustic alerts on these events:%%%
***Package Added, Package Removed, Package Moved, Package Replaced.%%%
**Note: Doesn't bling on transferring packages to the In Box via Bluetooth, only when putting the packages away (via __[IC/VC](http://www.40hz.org/ICVC)__). Would be handy, though, to have Newton advise of completed transfers (from/to) for BT, IR, too, esp. after lenghty book installs. ;=}%%%
*__D.__ New Sounds
**Tactile courteously provides new __[sets of sounds](http://www.tactile.com/downloads.html)__: Mac OS 7 sounds (makes Apple users turn their heads...), Star Wars sounds (go home, trekkies!), 2001 sounds (does this have "Hello Dave..."?)%%%
**__[BuiltIn Sounds](http://www.tactile.com/downloads.html)__ on the same page exposes the built-in sounds to the Sounds popup list, without any new sounds having to be installed (2 k __only__!).%%%
**What would be cool to have: Sounds from Dr Who, Battlestar Galactica, Mars Attacks...%%%
** More [Newton Sounds|http://www.unna.org/unna/sounds] incl. original Star Trek and Start Trek Next Generation. Also __[SoundIcons|http://www.unna.org/unna/sounds/SoundIcons]__ to be used in the Sound popuplist (incl. Tricorder -- brings back memoroes of Newton's original __[Tricorder](http://www.unna.org/unna/applications/Tricorder)__ app)...%%%
***Q: Where else are nice Newton sound packages on the web?%%%
***Q: What's the difference between the "Sounds" and "[[SoundIcons]]" at [[UNNA]]?
* __E. [SysPatch 0.5b|http://download.planetnewton.com/download/Util/Security20.htm]__ ([mirror|http://www.stillnewt.org/library/_Software/_Other%20Newton%20Applications/_System%20Patches]) by Hongkong's [Richard C.L. Li](http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~clli/index.html) claims to do something regarding "Global sound functions", whatever that means.%%%
** Q: Could somebody pls. investigate?
**Q: What's that Patch improving, anyway?%%%
* __F.__ [Serg Koren|http://www.visualnewt.com/Products/Newton/Newton.html]'s __[VoiceAlarm 1.0](http://mirrors.unna.org/download.planetnewton.com/download/media/addingsound2.htm)__ allows the use of different recorded sounds as an alarm.%%%
**Neat way to put ANY sound effect into your Preferences' Sound (Alarm, Sunrise) folders, just record it and it's there!%%%
*__G.__ [[SoundOff]] by [[DeepFocus]].com (Thx, Woo Lee!)
** What it do?

# More stupid Newton Audio Fun
*[[Audio]]
*[[MakeNewtonSpeakText]] with Macintalk voice synthesis. Use text-to-speech functionality with Notes, ebooks or implement voice synthesis in your development project!
*[[MakeNewtonSing]] - if you want to make your Newton sing Christmas carols (or anything else)
* __[ModPlayer](http://roger.trideja.com/newton/modplayer.html)__ plays music (.MOD files) at 22Khz mono. (The mod format itself is about 44Khz stereo, but the newton can't do that). A MOD file is a file containing one sample of each instrument which will be used, and a midi-like collection of note information. Alarm and sleep features allow you to use it as an alarm system!
* [MadNewt/MadMax](Audio) play MP3s on Newton OS 2.1
