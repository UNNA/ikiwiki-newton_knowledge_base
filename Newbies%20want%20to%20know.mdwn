__Frequently Asked Newbie-Questions__


>Q: Where can I find some explanations on using my Newton?

>A: For starters, you may want to check these sites:

* [UNNA|http://www.unna.org] has a lot of Newton manuals for download. VERY recommended! Many questions can be answered by some simple [RTFM]. And it is very rewarding - at first glance, Newtons look like a pretty basic device -- only after reading the manual you'll find all the cool features implemented in [NewtonOS]!

* [Official Newton FAQ|http://www.chuma.org/newton/faq]
** The FAQ is very instructive.

* [WikiWikiNewt for all kinds of articles| http://tools.unna.org/wikiwikinewt]
** The Wiki is general-to-special, much recommended. You can add articles, too, and esp. the newbies are strongly encouraged to do so: When you discover for yourself something new, post a Howto and help the next newbie. Post software reviews, HowTos and tips, e.g. when you've had a real problem, asked NTLK and got a satisfying answer that might help others in the future, post it at the Wiki.

* [NewtonTalk Mailing List|http://www.newtontalk.net]
** Here http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk&r=1&w=2 you can run searches against NTLK -- a very useful ressource.

>Q: Where can I find packages that work with (enter your Newton model here)?

>A: Check the SoftwareReviews and UnnaReviews here at the Wiki for some pointers.

Then there is [UNNA|http://www.unna.org], the central repository of Newton software.
Shareware, charityware, postcardware, abandonware, freeware - heaps of
software for NOS 1.x, 2.x and 2.1, plus manuals, Newton-relevant Mac- and PC-software, Newton commercials, developer tools, etc. ...
UNNA wants your help, too: Whenever you find an app that's not available at
UNNA yet, be sure to upload it and write a description for it. And whenever
you download something from UNNA and it doesn't have a description yet,
it's very good policy to write one after testing (and mark which OS it
worked with, and if the app can be rotated or not).
UNNA also has a error code database, if you even need to look up something.

Also there are many link-colections and other websites in numbers like you
wouldn't believe, and still some of the old-time Newton software companies
sell their apps (usually at reduced prices). Just do a bit of Google!
Tip: Often you'll find dead links to cool apps. Many of these webpags have
been archived and can be accessed either through Google's Cache service or
the Wayback Machine at http://www.archive.org. Very valuable!

>Q: How do I sync my Newton with MacOS X (Windows, Unix, Linux)?

>A: See [MacOSConnection] (WindowsConnection, [UNIXConnection]). Also check the [Official Newton FAQ|http://www.chuma.org/newton/faq].
