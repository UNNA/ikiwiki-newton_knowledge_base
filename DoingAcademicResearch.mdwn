The Newton makes the perfect tool for doing academic research with a few simple add-ons.

# [Matthew Reidsma's](MatthewSetup) Process

## The Add-on Applications:

* [[CardMedia]] - A collection of [[Names]] extensions that allow you to catalog Books, Articles, or other media in the [[Names]] application. (Available at your local [UNNA](http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/stationary/CardMEDIA).
* [[MoreInfo]] - This application by [SilverWARE|http://silverware.com] seamlessly integrates with the Newton's built-in [[Names]], [[Dates]], [[ToDoList]], [[Calls]], [[InOutBox]], [[NotePad]] (including voice recording stationary) and add-ons like [[NewtonWorks]] to provide extraordinary linking capabilities that transform the Newton into a full integrated information management system. (Commercial, [Download Free Trial](http://www.silverware.com/Moreinfo.shtml) ~$80 and worth every penny.)

## The Process:

I create new Book or Article cards in [[CardMedia]] when I encounter a reference I am interested in pursuing. I then tap the routing icon, and select "link to." (This is where [[MoreInfo]] comes in). I link the new Book or Article record to my next scheduled library visit in [[Dates]]. When I arrive at the library, the linked Book and Article cards tell me what items I need to retrieve. My university library almost always has the material that I need, but if not, I'll request it through Interlibrary Loan and then link the Book or Article card to the next library visit I schedule.

As I examine each source, I create a new linked note from each Book or Article card using [[MoreInfo]]. I write any citations or notes in the [[NotePad]], and they are linked both to and from the bibliographic citation.

To find citations by "keyword," I use either the built-in Find or [[Assist]] functions. I make heaby use of the [[Assist]] function for all of my Newton-related activities, and so it is natural for me to use it to find things. If I want to find everything containing the word "padua," I tap [[Assist]] and either select "Look for" from the drop-down menu or write "find padua." I can select to search everywhere on the Newton, including Calls, To-Dos, Notes, Works documents, Dates, or I can select only certain places to search. For research, I usually limit my search to the [[NotePad]] and [[NewtonWorks]].

I transfer my notes from the Newton to my [[PowerBook]] via [[BluetoothOBEX]]. In OS X it is also possible to move notes to the desktop using [Glass Onion Software's](http://homepage.mac.com/nowhereman77/hacks/newton/] [[NotePad]] plugin for [[NewtSync]] or [[SimonBell]]'s new Cocoa [[NCU]] replacement, [[NCX]).

I generally compose longer pieces on my [[PowerBook]], but will occasionally compose a document in pieces in the [[NotePad]] and then combine them into a larger, formatted document in [[NewtonWorks]] using [WorksBetter](NewtonWorksAddOns) by [[StandAlone]]. Jonathan Dueck also wrote an excellent page on [[ScholarlyWriting]] with the Newton and OSX running Bookends 9 and Nisus Writer.

## Other applications that can be helpful for the researcher:

* [[VoiceNotes]] - quickly read out that citation when your hand is sick of writing, and organize it as well.
* [[HyperNewt]] - Allows you to organize your notes in a more intuitive interface.
* [NewtNotes|http://www.catamount.com/[[NewtonApps]]/[[NewtNotes]].html] - An [EndNote|http://www.endnote.com/] interface for the Newt. No longer developed, but technically still supported, this software is really expensive. Unsure if it talks with newer versions of [EndNote](http://www.endnote.com/).
