Software engineer and nerd, loves to hack, feels he must understand the most secret internals of his MP2100. I also know, which end of the soldering iron is hot, and I don't hesitate to use this knowledge.

In real life, I am building robotic kits which also rely on PDA's or microcontrollers to walk about (http://robowerk.com).
