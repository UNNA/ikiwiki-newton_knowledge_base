The [[StrongArm]] CPU was a great choice at that time. With the success of previous Netwons, ARM and Apple seem to have put their heads together quite close and developed a CPU that provides some very special features that [[NewtonOS]] uses to the last bit.

* the CPU supports an interrupt and event base OS witha CPU sleep mode, a mechanism that Apple patented
* the MMU supports a high granularity and various access modes that provide a playground for the Newton preemtive multitasking with very fast task switching
* the MMU also provides a recovery in case the CPU access non-existing memory. The OS then remaps RAM to provide the "missing" memory.
* the CPU can be switched so that teh Newton 16bit wide FLASH RAM can be accessed as if it was 32bit wide

There are several ARM emulators out there in source code form. I would like to mention Armulator, which was developed by ARM themselves and put under GPL. It has been extended to support the [[StrongARM]] by the [[SkyEye]] team and can be downloaded under GPL as part of their project.
