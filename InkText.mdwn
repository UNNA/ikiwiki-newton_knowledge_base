InkText is a HandWritingRecognition setting where "raw" handwriting is saved as a series of 'images' in a Newton Note. Since the recognizer does not attempt to convert your writing into text, writing can be sped up considerably. For this reason some users prefer to use InkText for data entry, and have the recognizer convert the text for them later.
