Just some short info on a nearly dead battery:

I got the battery dead. Since it did not accept a charge (preliminary charge and then deeptoast), I put it in the fridge and cooled it to about 10C. Recharged, got 300 min. out of it. Used Battery Counter. But it died at just over 5V. And then very fast.

So I recharged it, and it was full after 10min. The next use was 100 min. So when it was empty for the Newton, I attached a little light bulb and let it burn for several hours. I think two or three. Well, I forgot about it and suddenly I saw the bulb wasn't burning any more.

Put it in the Newton, preliminary charge and the deeptoast, the little put-it-in-the-fridge-game and it charged for just under one hour. Use ![[BattTrax]]. Very normal charging curve. This gave me 650 min. of use!!!

The next charge was nearly the same. I'll have to see how long it stays. But since someone here had a similar report, I guess the battery wasn't used some time before and / or maybe just one cell is not as good as the others. So, really empty the battery and fully charge it . That seems to recondition a battery, which at first seems to be dead, in some way. I guess slow charge would be even better but I don't have the time for that sort of experiments.

Hope that helps people with thought-to-be-dead batteries.

## Another method:

Take the battery out, bang it hard against the floor and few times and
put it in the freezer overnight.

Then put it back in and charge it.

Rinse. Repeat if desired.

Worked great for me, with both my eMate (completely dead at the
beginning, 10 hours of use once I did three cycles of this silliness)
and my MP2100 battery.

Good luck,

## Reconditioning Method:

Reconditioning is another method you can use to resusitate a Dead Rechargeable Pack. I know that there are other commercial battery charging/conditioner equipment out there but, I mention this since I'm in possesion of the only aftermarket Charging/Conditioner designed specifically for use for the MP2000/2100 Rechargeable Packs.

Cheetah Universal Smart Charger by Alexander Technologies with MP2000 Cups (as they call it)

* NOTE: Unfortunately they are discontinued and they don't have replacement Cups for the MP2000 anymore either :(

You can of course do as the others suggested and bang it hard against the floor and few times and
put it in the freezer overnight. Then try their method, but I put them into the Cheetah Universal Smart Charger with the MP2000 Cups and charge them or condition without having to mind the store.

I know that I've only seen two of these units on eBay - of which I purchased this one the last one to appear. I can tell you that this setup works very well - I've been able to revive Dead packs and it defintely makes it easier to condition them (drain and recharge by using it's Conditioning Program which discharges the pack first and then charges them).

If anyone is interested in having their packs Reconditioned contact me.

PS: I'm in the process of building an adapter to accept eMate 300 Rechargeable Packs. Once I'm done I'll charge up the half full box of New Old Stock eMate 300 Rechargeable Packs I have if I've got time by then ;-)
