The Newton was shipped before the symbol for the new European currency "Euro" was introduced, so the system fonts don't know it.

This wish is for replacement system fonts with the Euro symbol and for a nice input method for the symbol (adding to on-screen keyboard, teaching the Newton to recognizig it as HWR, ...).

Please please please!

Another patch might be to hack the system / provide an add-on to the system to allow changing of currencies.  What with europe expanding, and all that, a fixed euro zone patch could be out of date soon.  But a euro zone patch (beyond that provided by the 'euroland' hack out there) would be most welcome.

As far as the font is concerned, you can port [[MacOS]] X roman fonts to the Newton and get the euro symbol on the Newton.
