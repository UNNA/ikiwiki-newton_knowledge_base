[Getting Things Done](http://www.davidco.com), or short GTD is a way to deal with tasks and projects in a self-organizing way. Here are a some ideas how to implement GTD on the Newton:

[[EckhartKoeppen]]:

This my previous setup:

* The software I use is [[DateMan]], [[MoreFolders]] and some homegrown extensions to [[DateMan]], plus the built-in Newton software
* My projects are represented as global folders in [[MoreFolders]]. Each project contains notes, tasks and appointments
* There are two things which I do differently than GTD: I don't have separate action lists, and I use [[DateMan]]'s task priorities
* Tasks are prioritized like this: A1 tasks have to be done today, A2 tasks should be done today as well, B tasks are enablers for other tasks but don't have a deadline yet, and C tasks are the rest
* Usually, I try to put tasks into the correct priority order each morning
* For each mail I get, there can only be one of four actions: do something about it right away, file it for reference, delete it, or create a task on the Newton to deal with it

Now I'm using [[FlashPoint]] (as usual on [40hz](http://40hz.org/wiki/index.php/Flashpoint))
