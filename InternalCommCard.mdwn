I would like to see one card with Bluetooth/802.11b&g/serial/USB/Stereo in\out/ placed on a daughter card where the original modem was to be placed. I would also want each of the capabilities to be hot, meaning that they can be turned on and off via software, preferably a pop-up menu and without restarting the Message Pad.

This would also require a set of drivers to enable such a piece of hardware.

Additional Data: There's been a [prototype by Apple|AppleMultifunctionInterconnectAdapter] that replaced the [Interconnect] port on MP 2x00 wth Audio In/Out, Power In and two (!) serial ports.
