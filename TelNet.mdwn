I managed to enable telnet access on my iBook running 10.2.8 and connected successfully from my MP2100 over [[WiFi]], this is how I did it:

Open Terminal.app

Type this: _cd /usr/libexec_

Then this: _sudo -s_

Then your admin password

Then this: _./telnetd -debug_

Then go to System Prefs and open port 23

Then telnet to your macs IP address (port 23) and login (I've had great fun initiating applications with the open command)

It's not as secure as ssh, but it'll work until someone manages to create a newton ssh client anyway.

Oh, and BTW. It will stop the daemon after you disconnect. If you need to have it enabled all the time, edit the /etc/inetd.conf file so the line:

_#telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/libexec/tcpd	telnetd_

looks like this:

_telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/libexec/tcpd	telnetd_

(i.e. remove the # to uncomment it)


You also have to edit the first line in:

_/etc/xinetd.d/telnet_

from:

_disable = yes_

to:

_disable = no_


Please note that I have not had time to test this second method so it may not work. You will need to open the port whichever method you use. (to someone with 10.3 or later: Please try this and edit this page to say if it works or not, cheers)

Remember this is telnet, so the usual considerations apply as everything is in plain text!

(The reason why the title says 10.1 or later is because in 10.0.4 and earlier telnet is enablable through the Sharing Prefrence Pane)
