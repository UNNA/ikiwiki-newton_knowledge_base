This problem applies mainly to people using Apple computers. I'm one of them. You can buy various USB to Serial Adapters, but there are only few models that actually work under MacOS X 10.2 and higher, includes 10.3 .

# [BAFO BF-810 USB to Serial DB9|http://www.bafo.com/pro01.asp?idno=81]. You'll need a DB-9F to mini DIN-8M null-modem adaptor to make this work, but work it does. Drivers for OS X 10.3.4 on the [BAFO driver page|http://www.bafo.com/bafo/prodrivers.asp]. The driver package contains a bunch of files, but just install all of them and it seems to work.
