Some users have reported problems publishing with nBlog, but whether this was a fault in the app or a broken feature on the Blogger site was up for debate. For completeness, here is an excerpt from the newtontalk list, quoting the clairvoyant Peter Cameron:

_My prefs for nBlog 1.0a9 are:_ %%%

_Host: api.blogger.com_ %%%
_Path: /api/RPC2_ %%%
_Port: 80_ %%%
_Blogger 1.0_ %%%
_username: xxxx_ %%%
_password: xxxx_ %%%
_always publish is checked._

_I have found that nBlog will no longer work through my DSL connection. However, it works fine via dialup._
