So you're a Newton user who's looking for a certain etext. Of course you've checked the sites listed on AvailableNewtonLibraries if the book is already available somewhere (would be a shame to do a book that's already available, wouldn't it? One might as well read the existing book and contribute the effort scheduled for making this to another one that hasn't been Newtonized yet).

On this page, you'll find an index of good etext sites. Note that there is going to be some fluctuation with these archives, so it might be advised to check any dead-but-promising-sounding links against the [Wayback Machine(tm)|http://www.archive.org/]. Also websearches may take you to sites not yet listed here (in which case we'd be more than glad if you'd be so kind as to add them below ;=} ), or maybe you'd start from one of many other [link collections|http://www.e-book.com.au/freebooks.htm] - there's treasure everywhere!
