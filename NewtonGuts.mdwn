This group of pages describes many internals of the Newton MP2100. The purpose of this collection is to understand the wonderful implementation of [[NewtonOS]] and to create a knowledge base for hardware extensions and software drivers.

### Hardware Details Message Pad 2001

Hardware:
* Processing
** [[GutsCpu]]: [[StrongARM]] SA-110 running in big endian 32bit mode
*** MMU: The MMU is an integral part of the CPU. [[NewtonOS]] uses every aspect of the MMU
*** DMA: Sound input, output and serial interfaces use DMA to take load off the CPU
*** [[GutsInterrupts]]: 32 Interrupt source are supported
** [[GutsVoyager]] ASIC: The great mystery part of the Newton
** [[GutsRom]]: 8MB ROM (but there is more space on the ROM board), located at 0x00000000
** [[GutsRex]]: (REx) [[NewtonOS]] supports up to 8 ROM Extensions that can contain drivers and software
** [[GutsFlashRam]]: 4MB at 0x02000000, many access restrictions
** [[GutsDynamicRam]]: 4MB at 0x04000000, but will be mapped to other places by the MMU
* Devices
** PCMCIA: the two PCMCIA ports are mapped to 0x3c000000(?) and 0x4c000000(?)
** Screen: resolution is 320x480, 4 grays, using dynamic RAM mapped to 0xe0000000
** Digitizer: resistive, position is read using two high-res DAC's
** Serial ports
*** Sync port (port 1)
*** Modem port
*** Debug port (port 3)
*** IR port
** Speaker: using DMA and interrupts, no load on CPU
** Microphone: using DMA and interrupts, no load on CPU
** Power and reset switch: using interrupts(?)
** Connectors:
*** external expansion port
*** internal expansion port
*** power
