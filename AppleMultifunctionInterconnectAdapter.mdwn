__Multifunction Interconnect Adapter__


__What:__ Replace MP 2x00's [Interconnect] port with Audio In/Out, Power In and two (2) serial ports.

__Background:__ "There's been the "[Apple Multifunction Interconnect Adapter | http://www.normalkid.com/collector/inter.html]" discussed a couple days ago [at NTLK|http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk.2004-04/0620.html], which totally replaces the Interconnect socket with line out, line in, power line and two (2) serial ports. Sweet. And that rolled in one with, let's say... *[Bluetooth]* - that would be truly amazing."
([DJV| http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk.2004-04/0911.html])

__Benefit:__ Get rid of flimsy Interconnect adapter and [dongle] need. Replace [SER001] with more complete solution, feat. audio and Bluetooth for the masses. Leave current SER001 real estate free for other uses (e.g. [Implant] board). Use two serial devices (e.g. keyboard, GPS) simultaneously while hooked up to network via Bluetooth.

__Additional Data:__ Any additional input appreciated.
