There are two __PCMCIA-VGA adaptors__ known to exist for the Newton, both manufactured under the EZShow brand. These cards, the EZ2VGA and later EZ2TV card, mirror the newton's greyscale screen on any VGA-equipped monitor, or, as in the case of the EZ2TV Card, pretty much anything with VGA, S-video or RCA video-in. These cards are very rare on the used market, often going for upwards of $200 at eBay auctions. Their form factor is that of a PCMCIA card connected by thick cable to a [[breakout box]]

Other VGA cards manufactured at this time for use with PCMCIA-equipped powerbooks are not known to work with Newtons.
