Add backup-capacitor to eMates and make 'em keep time and date like all other Newtons do! This wish inspired by something StephanieMaks [once said|http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&m=103200841011554&w=2]:

"when removing the main battery, even for a brief moment, the time and date are lost.  No data is lost.  The eMate does not have a back-up capacitor like the MP2x00 does (though it wouldn't be too hard to add one)."
