The __Button Bar__ in the MP2X00 series is the Newton's effective command centre, visible over every application and automatically launched at startup. The manner in which one can customise the icons contained in its boundaries appears to have leant some influence to the Dock in __[[NeXT]]__ and __Mac__ __OS__ __X__.

If you delete a file in an application such as Notes you can see the rather obvious examples of this as the document scrunches up and floats to the Watebasket with superb sound effects =] Just as whimsical as the genie effect is OSX. %%%
