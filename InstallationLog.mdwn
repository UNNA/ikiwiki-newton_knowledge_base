__Installation Log (Tool)__


__What:__ Logs installation and deletion of any package.

__Background:__ Sometimes you don't know what you installed together or when or in what order. For some apps, this is important, also cross-installing some stuff may result in having stability issues. - Logs name of package, developer, date created, date installed, date deleted, any comments, allows sorting data by the first five categories mentioned.

__Benefit:__ Allows to identify possibly conflicting packages, will allow to pinpoint what packages were installed last before any problem occured.

__Additional Data:__ Any additional input appreciated.
