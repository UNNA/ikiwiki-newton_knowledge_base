"Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of
prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no
such separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable. The beginner
should approach style warily, realizing that it is himself he is
approaching, no other; and he should begin by turning resolutely away
from all devices that are popularly believed to indicate style--all
mannerisms, tricks, adornments. The approach to style is by way of
plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity."
