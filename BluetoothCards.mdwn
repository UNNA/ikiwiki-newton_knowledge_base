## Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a medium to short distance (1m up to 100m) wireless standard. It can be used for serial connections, as a cable replacement. It also allows Object Exchange (OBEX) like [[IrDA]] and web-sharing (TCP via BT).

[Blunt](http://www.40hz.org/Blunt) is a Bluetooth-driver for the Newton.
