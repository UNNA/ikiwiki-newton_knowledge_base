__PDF Reader/Writer (Tool)__


__What:__ Read PDFs on your Newton, print to PDF driver, edit PDFs (cut, append, etc.)

__Background:__ There's some stuff available to convert PDFs to Newton-friendly data, but no proper Newton reader or writer.

__Benefit:__ Makes Newtons more compatible with ever-present PDF-based document workflows. Read PDFs without any conversion hustle. Create PDFs from any Newton app.

__Additional Data:__
* [Some threads|http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&w=2&r=1&s=xpdf&q=b] at NTLK might find people well worth to talk to.
* See [nPDF| http://dev.newtontalk.net/~martinw/Ideas%20pages/nPDF.html] at Newton's Bulb which also names a contact person for this topic.
* Jim Witte has also looked into this matter (http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2002-August/001923.html).
