__Driver for VGA Cards__


__What:__ Driver for more VGA PC Cards

__Background:__ Two PC Card-format VGA-adapters have drivers for the Newton. One of these cards has a tendency to blow under certain conditions and both are pretty rare nowadays (2004). There are quite a bunch of other VGA cards on the market, and it would be great to have drivers available for more of these cards.

__Benefit:__ Use Newton w/ VGA & keyboard as "desktop" computer, or turn it with a [game pad](GravisStingerGamePad) to the ultimate video game console. Run presentations off the Newton. Display on computer display, video beamer, maybe even tv. Plus it would be way cool. ;=}
