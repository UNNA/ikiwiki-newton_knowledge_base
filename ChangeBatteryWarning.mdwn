The battery-low warning comes at 20% of the capacity - that's at a time when my battery pack still has quite a couple days of power, so this annoying warning leads to early recharging rather than having to tap that warning slip away all the time. But that's wasteful and quite detrimental to the [[NiMHs]] lifespan, so...


_Q:_ How can I set the level for battery low warnings?

_A:_ Options by SBM does this things and is freeware (http://www.sbm.nu/englisch/newton/index.htm -- NOS 2.x only).
