!!Newton and Accessories Power Consumption Specs

For Newton OS 2.1 devices (MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100 and eMate, you can easily evaluate the current consumption by using Frank Gruendel's [NewtTest|http://www.pda-soft.de/newttest.html] application. Simply install it, select the battery subtest and make sure no AC adapter is connected.%%%
Earlier models do not allow access to the Newton's current consumption by software. For these models you will have to measure current by some different means.

Add the values for each of the component you have attached to yor Newton, and you get a pretty good idea how long your setup might run, which are the power hogs, and which other accessories might be more energy efficient.%%%


Some observations:%%%
"My personal experience when using MP2100 with 4 x fresh/new AA NiMH 2300Ma:%%%
 - using SerialConnection for everything (faxing, docking, text input) will let your batteries last 7 days%%%
 - using Bluetooth for IC/VC with OBex (send-receive-install packages), receive mails everyday paired with a bluetooth enabled phone plus a weekly full backup will let your batteries last less than 4 days%%%
- using a 56k pcmcia modem for send/receive mails, with sessions of 10minutes, will let batteries last less than 3 days%%%
- using WiFi for docking, webbing, synching, and a couple of remote VNC sessions of 5minutes will let batteries last less than 2 days.%%%

Different configurations will do different things, although so, the MessagePad batteries will always last more when using serial connectivity. Apple choose to put a serial host in the Newton for a good reason i think. The Harris Supertech, licensed by Apple to Harris Corp, had amazing wireless capabilities built-in, but fully charged batteries could last less than 4 (!) hours as on official press documentation.%%%

My personal experience concerning nonstop-runtime:%%%
 - 4 x AA 2100 NiMH being a "power user" will let your batteries last 24 hours%%%
 - 4 x AA 2300 NiMH being a "power user" will let your batteries last 36 hours%%%
 - 4 x AA 2500 NiMH being a "power user" will let your batteries last 48 hours" (AdrianoAngelillis)%%%
