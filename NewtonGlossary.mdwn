!!the Real Newton glossary!!
The Newton Glossary is a large repository of Newton-related terms and acronyms, obtained from a variety of sources.  There are two versions: the [searchable version|http://guelph.unna.org/glossary/] and the [static version](http://www.splorp.com/newton/glossary/).  The static version also has a downloadable Newton Package version.

!!Packages!!
A program or application on Windows or Mac OS, is known as a Package on the Newton. The word "package" has way too many meanings beyond this. A Package is also the icon that shows up in the Extras drawer or can be placed on the button bar on the MessagePad2000 or MessagePad2100. A package is file on a desktop computer with the extension ".pkg".

Mac OS X added a new wrinkle: the extension ".pkg" also refers to a Macintosh application _and its supporting files_ that is bundled up into a folder with an icon that looks like the actual appliction.

Newton users with Macs have to take care of these issues.
