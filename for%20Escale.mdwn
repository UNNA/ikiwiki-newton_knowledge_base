From Tom Isenbarger:%%%

Connecting Newton to Mac (running OS X and Escale) over wireless:

On the computer (this is for Mac OS X 10.3.3 running on a 15"
Alumininum Powerbook G4, 1 GHz, with an Airport Extreme card):%%%

1.  Appletalk must be active for the Airport connection on the computer
(System Preferences > Network > Show Airport > [[AppleTalk]] > Make [[AppleTalk]] active > Apply Now).%%%

2.  A) In the menubar if there is an Airport item there, or B) in Internet Connect > Airport %%%

choose Create Network (it doesn't have to be called "Newton", but it is case sensitive).%%%

Mine is called "spaceman" and is set on channel 11 (Automatic)%%%

3.  Internet sharing is off%%%

4.  Launch Escale and wait for Appletalk access to be active
(indicated by the icon looking something like this <---> becoming black and not grey)%%%



on the Newton (mine is a MP2100 with Lucent [[WaveLAN]] silver)

1.  Wireless card is set to work in "infrastructure" mode (channel is not important).
This also worked in "ad-hoc" mode.  I didn't try "ad-hoc (old-fashioned)" mode.%%%

Paul Guyot:
I noticed that this setting has no importance with Lucent cards, but  it does with other cards. With other cards, you would need to connect in ad-hoc mode (with the channel set properly to 11).%%%

2.  In Dock, I choose connect via Appletalk, choose other computer and
"spaceman" shows up.  Now instead of where it used to say "Desktop
computer" it says "spaceman", so I don't have to choose "other
computer" any more.

3.  Sometimes if I have just switched worksites, or if I haven't connected to this particular computer in a little while, when I try to to connect the <---> symbol briefly (few seconds) goes grey and then comes back to black.  Also, sometimes my connection fails on this first try.  If I try to connect again, it almost always connects successfully.  It's as if the first connect attempt has to reset the Appletalk connection, allowing the second trial to work.

Paul Guyot:
You have to do it to activate [[AppleTalk]] on the Mac. In your case,
[[AppleTalk]] was active (hence the black <...> icon in Escale), but if
there is no other computer connected to the network, [[MacOS]] X shuts
the interface down and you need to hook the Newton to the network
with choosing "other computer" to have the Mac fire the interface up.
Then you have to wait for 10 seconds before the [[AppleTalk]] stack is
completely up and Escale's service is registered.
