NCU comes with a number of translators for various Windows PIM applications.  One of them is Lotus Organizer v2.1.  It can be downloaded from UNNA.

Here is the procedure:

1.  Install Lotus Organiser 2.1 and restart the PC.

2.  Create a new data file and save it in your directory of choice eg. D:\data\allan.or2

3.  Close LO2

4.  Start NCU and run as many Slowdown sessions as you can without seizing up your PC

5.  Click file-synchronisation settings

6.  Click which applications you want synchronised eg names, dates, notes

7.  Click the right hand box for each app and it will give you a list of translators

8.  Click the LO2 translator in each case and browse to the LO2 data file location you set up earlier; you should see your file

9.  Click your file and click OK

10.  Repeat for each app you want to synch

11.  Click OK and return to the main NCU screen

12.  Start Dock on your Newton

13.  Click connect

14.  Click synchronise on NCU; be patient it could take a while.

15.  If you get the (-1) error then add another session of Slowdown and start again.
