There are devices capable of converting a physical serial connection to a wireless connection.

Such devices can convert a serial connection to a wireless one using a RF component, a bluetooth or a 802.11b chip, with full protocol conversion.

Particularity of such devices is the "transparency" of the signals, which are recognized by more common Bluetooth/WiFi/RF receivers without matter.

Although the transparency of such communications, WEP is still available.

Any MessagePad can communicate through a SerialToWireless converter using default system serial link.

*'Blunt' is not required on SerialToBluetooth sync
*Some SerialToWiFi interfaces, fully configurable via AT commands, do not need the 'Wave LAN' driver

Take a look to the tested devices list on the SerialToWireless page.
