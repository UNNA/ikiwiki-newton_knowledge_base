# Description
The [[MessagePad]] 130 personal digital assistant (PDA) makes your information as mobile as you are. It makes your information easy to communicate and easy to view.

With its additional system memory, the [[MessagePad]] 130 offers improved performance with communications solutions such as Internet Protocol (IP) applications and wireless LANs, as well as improved multitasking support.

It has a built-in notepad, to-do list, datebook, telephone log, and address file for organizing personal and business affairs, as well as Pocket Quicken (U.S. only) to help organize personal and business expenses.

Improved recognition soft-ware quickly transforms your hand-writing into typed text. There's even an optional external keyboard.

Pen-based navigation and data entry make finding information easy and fast.
