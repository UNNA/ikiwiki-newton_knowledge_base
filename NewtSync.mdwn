NewtSync (sometimes known as nSync) is a Mac OS X native application, coupled with a connection package on the Newton. It is built as an easily extendable transfer-and-sync solution for OS X users via TCP/IP or serial. Out-of-the-box, it supports AddressBook, iCal, and clock syncing. John Anderson, the original developer, released it as open source after stopping working on it. Currently, there is a [NewtSync homepage on SourceForge|http://sourceforge.net/projects/newtsync/] as well as a more up-to-date page from the current maintainer, Chris Hagedorn. Steven Frank, the author of [NewTen|http://www.panic.com/~stevenf/index.php?node=NewTen], has started exploring additional development of NewtSync. Huzzah!
