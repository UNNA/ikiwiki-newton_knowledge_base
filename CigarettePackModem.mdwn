This is a 2400 data modem [9600 bps facsimile] that is roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes.  It has an RJ-11 telephone jack, is powered by 2 x AA size batteries ["accu"], or can also be powered by the Newton AC adapter.

(note that many internet service providers no longer accept connections at 2400 bps)
