In a situation where you for instance have acquired a larger memory card and want to move the contents from a smaller card to the new:%%%

__Restore__%%%
The simplest way is to%%%
a. Make a backup on your desktop computer of the smaller card with NCU or the like%%%
b. Format the new card and give  it a name%%%
c. Restore (with NCU) the new card with information from the old card.%%%
This moves everything: packages, soups (files)....%%%

__Beaming__%%%
If you have two Newtons, you can have the old card in Newton 1 and the new card in Newton 2 and set the new card to be the selected card for ' Save new info and packages on this card' or 'set default store' (depending on card type and driver).
Then beam the packages from Newton 1 to 2: Select the package, tap the router button (envelope), select 'beam'. The Newtons Ir windows must face each other - not too close, not too far apart (I used 20-50 cm...).%%%
Some Soups cannot be selected and beamed this way, and some soups have to be beamed one file at a time (Notes). For such the application 'Soup Transport' is a help. It can be found at [http://www.sbm.nu/englisch/newton/souptransport/index.htm], it has a 7 days demo period for you to see if it does what you need. Install it on both Newtons. %%%
If you beam a large number of files, remember to: 1. On Newton 2: 'Put Away' the info by going into In/Out - Inbox, and finding the soups, tap the button between the 'receive' button and the 'file (folder)' button and select Put Away. 2. On Newton 1: Delete the list of sent soups by going into In/Out - Outbox, marking the files and tapping the envelope button, selecting Delete. If you have little internal space, this list can take up so much room it blocks further beaming and gives the error message: 'Internal store full'.
