Eckhart is the developer of many useful Newton packages, such as The Fish ([[NotePad]] encryption), [[Courier]] (text-based webbrowser) and [MAD Newton] (MAD-based MP3 decoder for Newton). He is best known for his work on Newton communication interfaces with  [[Nitro]] (which brings the [[IrCOMM]] Communications Protocol to Newton) and most of all Blunt, the Newton [[Bluetooth]] driver. As of Spring 2006, a major redesign of the [[Bluetooth]] driver is underway (Blunt 2).

His software is open source (GPL- or LGPL-licensed) and available with source code from his website 40Hz.org.
