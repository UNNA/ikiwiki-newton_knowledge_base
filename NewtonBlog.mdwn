nBlog is a Newton app written by Adam Tow for working with sites such as [ blogger | http://new.blogger.com/home.pyra ]. nBlog allows you to update your weblog from wherever you and your Newton might be. You man download Adam's nBlog, XML-RPC, and the totally kick-ass nHTML 2 all in one archive via  [ tow.com | http://www.tow.com/weblog/newton_web_apps.zip].

Some users have reported problems publishing with nBlog, but whether this was a fault in the app or a broken feature on the Blogger site was up for debate. For completeness, here is an excerpt from the newtontalk list, quoting the clairvoyant Peter Cameron:

 ''My prefs for nBlog 1.0a9 are:'' %%%

    ''Host: api.blogger.com'' %%%
    ''Path: /api/RPC2'' %%%
    ''Port: 80'' %%%
    ''Blogger 1.0'' %%%
    ''username: xxxx'' %%%
    ''password: xxxx'' %%%
    ''always publish is checked.''

    ''I have found that nBlog will no longer work through my DSL connection. However, it works fine via dialup.''
