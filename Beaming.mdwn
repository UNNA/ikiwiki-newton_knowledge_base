Beaming is the act of sending or receiving data on the Newton via the wirless link provided by an [IrDAConnection]. Newtons of similar vintage are capable of beaming each other, but not every Newton can beam every other. My MP100 OS1.0 can beam names to my MP120 OS2.0, and the MP120 can beam names to my MP2100. But the MP100 cannot beam names to my MP2100. YMMV.

Beaming is accomplished by the Receiving party, assuming his Newton is NOT set to receive Beams automatically, opening his InOutBox, selecting the Out box if not active, and choosing "Beam" from the Receive menu.
The Beaming party opens the Note, Name, Document, Image, Package, etc he wishes to send, and choosses "Beam" from the Routing Menu.
