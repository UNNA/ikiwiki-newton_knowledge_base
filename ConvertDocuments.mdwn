__PDF Converter__

Eric Schneck has made some modifications to Hendrik Lipka's [ PDFConvert | http://www.hendriklipka.de/newton/pdfconv.html] original java-based pdf converter. In his words:

''The PDF Converter is designed to convert a PDF file into an image format that is suitable for display on a Newton MessagePad or eMate. The program can generate output for a Web Browser, or for Newton Book Maker. The output could probably also be used for Newton Press, if you can get that program to work correctly.''

''The output is in an image format, rather than HTML or some other formatted text. The reason is that it is virtually impossible to render a page accurately outside of a PDF, especially on a Newton. Many page elements, such as rotated text, are not available outside of PDF, at least on a Newton.''

''Therefore, PDF Convert writes its output to image files that can then be loaded onto the Newton and viewed in precisely their original format, with all of their fonts, graphics, shading, etc. Note that depending on the desired resolution, and on how many graphics the original PDF contained, the converted document will be two to ten times larger than the original PDF.''

''The PDF Converter program itself is written in Java 2, and should run on any computer that supports Java 1.3 or 1.4. Unfortunately, the "classic" MacOS (8.x or 9.x) does not have a Java 2 runtime available, and therefore can not run PDFConverter, although the Book Maker output is formatted for the Mac version of Book Maker.''

''The conversions will NOT be done on the Newt! They will be done on a Mac (or maybe a PC) and the resulting NewtonBook or Mapper Module or Web page could be transferred to the Newt.''
