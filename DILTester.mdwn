!!!Newton Data Browser (aka. Newton DIL Tester) by Thomas Tempelmann

Latest information can be found here: http://www.tempel.org/newton/#DILplugin

This tool, for Mac OS 8-9 (not OS X!) and Windows, was an effort to replace Apple's NCU eventually.

It never made it, though, mostly due to bugs in the used "DIL" library from Apple, leading to crashes with larger amounts of data. Thomas also made an attempt later to use the DCL instead, but the DCL is not complete enough for what this tool needs and so Thomas gave up on this as well after a while.

You may still find use for the tool when you're using Windows or a Mac running Mac OS 8 or 9.

Features:
* On the Mac, it can install packages onto a Newton 2x000 via IrDA
* Can talk to the Newton via TCP/IP, provided a special TCP/IP package is installed on the Newton first
* Browse soups and store their data on the Mac or PC, also search for data in soups that way.
* Use the Mac or PC for typing on your newton (same as with NCU)

Expect no more new versions.

RIP
