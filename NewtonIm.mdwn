Subject: [[NTLK]] Getting AIM to work on a MP2x00

Here's my walk-thru as promised.

Things You'll Need:

- [[NewtonIM]] (http://www.allaboutjake.com/newton/NIM.pkg)
- AIM Account (http://www.aim.com)
- Jabber Client (http://www.jabber.org)

First things first. Obtain a jabber client for your platform  that
supports browsing, this will allow you to browse the jabber server for
the other gateways (AIM, MSN, Yahoo...) that they have installed. I
chose netmindz.net. Create an account on the server, remember the user
name and password. Login to the server and add the AIM transport agent
(aim.netmindz.net  for example) and add your AIM account information.
Next,  add your AIM Buddies to the AIM transport and logout of the
jabber server.

Now install [[NewtonIM]] and tap on the icon and the jabber server account
info, (username, password and server name..) Resource doesn't seem to
affect anything.. tap connect and away you go..
