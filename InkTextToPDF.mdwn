I've just figured out how to create a Newton ink notes / sketch --> PDF RIP for my eMate 300, and I thought I'd share this with the Wiki. This might be useful to you if you want to preserve ink text as real line art, and / or take a lot of ink text notes that you don't intend to recognize.

(For me, the below was much faster than the LPR driver over [[WiFi]] [[PrintingInOSXUsingLPR]], which can also be set up to print to a PDF RIP such as CUPS-PDF <http://www.codepoetry.net/projects/cups-pdf-for-mosx>, and it didn't require me to take out my storage card either. If you have a 2100, the LPR driver option is probably a better bet for you, and if you use a pre-OS X Mac, you can do the below more easily by printing to a Desktop Printer over Localtalk, I believe.)

Here's what I did:

First, I installed the Newton Print Pack 2 drivers (<http://mirrors.unna.org/ftp.amug.org/pub/newton/utilities/2.x/newton-print-pack-2.0.sit.hqx>) on my Newton.

Then, I downloaded and installed the Sytek Soft Print Pack (<http://www.sytek.ca/products/newton/spp/license.htm>) and installed it on my Windows XP Pro PC.

Soft Print Pack required two files that weren't on my PC to run, so I Googled and installed them as well. First, =MSSTDFMT.dll= (I searched my Office 2004 CD for the file, but you can also google for a link to it), a Microsoft format library. I copied this file to my =WINDOWS/SYSTEM= directory and entered this into the command-line: =regsvr32.exe msstdfmt.dll=. Secondly, it needed =MSCOMM32.ocx= (an ActiveX control), which I downloaded from <http://www.keyghost.com/keyghostml/MSCOMM32.OCX> and then copied the file to my =WINDOWS/SYSTEM32= directory.

With these two files installed, Soft Print Pack started on my PC. I opened up the "Registration Code" file (in the =Program Files/Soft Print= Pack directory) and entered the registration code, and the program ran very nicely.

Then, I created a PCL printer (since Postscript requires network printing) using the Windows Control Panel / Add Printers: an HP [[LaserJet]] 4, set to print to a file rather than a "real" serial / parallel port.

I set the Soft Print Pack to print to my "[[LaserJet]]" by clicking "Settings," picking "Windows Printer" and selecting "HP Laserjet 4"

Then I downloaded and installed the (GPL'ed) PDF Creator (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/]) and a PCL Viewer called Downloader2006, which includes PCL6, an otherwise hard-to-find binary of the GPL'ed [[GhostPCL]] ([http://www.cyrtech.de/progs/dl2006/Downloader51302.msi] and [http://www.cyrtech.de/progs/dl2006/PCL6.msi>).

This was all the software I needed (enough though, ain't it?)

To make this actually work, I:

*Started Soft Print Pack on the PC.

*Connected the Newt to the PC with a serial cable (COM1).

*Selected my ink (or other) documents from the Newt, hit print, and selected "Other Printer" / "HP Laserjet" as my printer.

*Saved the ink documents when prompted, on the PC, to the Desktop as "filename.pcl"

*Started Downloader2006 on the PC, and chose the PCL Previewer. I opened the "filename.pcl" file and viewed it (opens your Windows image viewer).

*I then printed the image from the Windows Image Viewer to the "PDF Creator" virtual printer, creating lovely, cross-platform-friendly line art.

Sounds complicated, no? However, it isn't difficult after the first time or so. And it's the fastest way I've found (including LPR, X-Port, and NCU) to transfer lots of ink text, intact, to the Desktop.
