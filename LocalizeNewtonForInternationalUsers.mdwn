!B2Uni Translator

The encoding system on the Newton is UNICODE, while most of the electronic documents in traditional Chinese language are encoded with Big5 code. Joseph Chens's B2Uni (available from his website http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html) is a small Newton extension to do the translation job. It is needed for Newt's Cape Chinese.
B2Uni Translator is based on NTEncoding by GNUE (aka Makoto Nukui).

!Chinese Input Methods

*Joseph Chen offers a [Chinese Input Method| http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/input_methods/index.html] which is based on a modular design. You can choose your own input method module(s) and install separately what you need. A generic input method is automatically installed, which is nothing but a writing panel for Roman script input. At the time of this writing, the available modules are,
** PinYin/Phrase Input Module
** CangJie Input Module
** Cantonese Input Module
** Boshiamy Module
** Simplified CangJie Input Module
** Alternative Cantonese Input Module
*Radicals for NewtonOS 2.x
**[Radicals|http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/Radicals/] by SeanLuke is a radical/stroke-based Chinese input system designed to be used like Chinese dictionaries are. Native Chinese won't find it very useful, but non-native students of the language will find it indespensable.
*Cantonese Yale Romanization Input Module for NewtonOS 2.x
**Based on data provided by SeanLuke, Joseph Chen created a Yale Romanization input module for his [Chinese Input Method| http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/input_methods/index.html]. This input module makes it possible to enter Chinese characters into the Newton by writing their romanizations. However, it was never added to the collection on Joseph Chen's web page, so SeanLuke makes it available on [his own website|http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/YaleInput/]. Joseph does have two earlier (non-Yale) Cantonese input modules which don't work as well as this one.


!Chinese Dictionaries

*CharDict and CharDict+ for NewtonOS 2.x
**[CharDict|http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/CharDict/] is a dictionary of 4000 basic Chinese characters, including definitions, pronounciations in Mandarin and Cantonese, traditional and simplified variants, and usage frequency.
**[CharDict+|http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/CharDict/] is all that plus 2600 or even 14,000 compound Chinese words to boot.


!Chinese Fonts
*Joe Chen hosts [Chinese fonts and a Lextionary engine| http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html].
* SeanLuke hosts more [Chinese and laser printer fonts|http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/Fonts/] for the Newton MessagePad.

** (Q: Is the NOS 2.0 version also okay for NOS 2.1?)

*Note:* "If you input Japanese in Names or Dates _without_ having *Japanese Enabler* installed, you will break the soup and lose all your data in memory. But I tested that NotePad has no problem inputing Japanese without *Japanese Enabler*." (T. Murai)

!Japanese Input Systems
    There are 6 ways.

!Russian Localization Info
[Anton Balaban|mailto:anton@balaban.ru] has a great page on Russian Newton localization on [his website|http://www.balaban.ru/newt/russian.htm] for NOS 1.x and 2.x (in Russian). Offers Newton dictionaries, fonts, keyboard drivers and many great tips.

!Cyrillic Reading Pack for Newton
Cyrillic is Joe Chen's port of a freeware X Window Cyrillic font to Newton platform (Unicode) and available from his website http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html. Also enclosed with the distribution are code translation modules for GNUE's (aka Makoto Nukui) NTEncoding, with which you're able to send/receive files with any software that supports NTEncoding (notably Steve Weyer's Newt's Cape.) The supported translations are
    # MacCyrillic (Russian) <-> Unicode
    # ISO 8859-5 <-> Unicode
    # KOI-R <-> Unicode
    # Win 1251 <-> Unicode

You can also use UniTaipeiX (avaiblable from Joe's website) which comes with full set of Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1), traditional Chinese (Big5), Japanese Kana and Kanji (JIS 208) and Cyrillic characters (KOI-R). There is also a code translator that can make it easy to share data between Newton and a desktop.

!Cyrillic Writing Pack for Newton
Joseph Chen's Cyrillic Writing Pack http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html includes a Cyrillic keyboard with which you can type Cyrillic in your Newton and a TapBar button for transliteration (Latin->Cyrillic). Joe is using Graffiti as keyboard and found the input of Cyrillic like a breeze.

Joseph Chens's B2Uni (available from his website http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html) is a small Newton extension to do the translation job. It is needed for Newt's Cape Chinese.
B2Uni Translator is based on NTEncoding by GNUE (aka Makoto Nukui).

!Chinese Input Method
Joe Chen also offers a Chinese Input Method http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/input_methods/index.html which is based on a modular design. You can choose your own input method module(s) and install separately what you need. A generic input method is automatically installed, which is nothing but a writing panel for Roman script input. At the time of this writing, the available modules are,
        * PinYin/Phrase Input Module
        * CangJie Input Module
        * Cantonese Input Module
        * Boshiamy Module
        * Simplified CangJie Input Module
        * Alternative Cantonese Input Module

!Chinese Fonts and Dictionary
Joe Chen also hosts Chinese fonts and a Lextionary engine http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html .

[Tomoyoshi Murai|mailto:tmurai@mars.dtinet.or.jp] has a very good page on Japanese Newton Localization: _Japanese Bitmap Font for Newton OS_ ([English|http://tmurai-web.hp.infoseek.co.jp/computers/freeware/newton/jfont/newtonfont.html], [Japanese|http://tmurai-web.hp.infoseek.co.jp/computers/freeware/newton/jfont/newtonfontj.html])

!Japanese Enabler
NewtonOS Patch to support Japanese, released by Apple Japan for Japanese market only.
* [For MP130|ftp://ftp.apple.co.jp/pub/AppleJapan/Newton/Update526205-J.sea.hqx]
* [For MP120 NOS 2.0|ftp://ftp.apple.co.jp/pub/AppleJapan/Newton/Update516205-J.sea.hqx]
** (Q: Is the NOS 2.0 version also okay for NOS 2.1?)

*Note:* "If you input Japanese in Names or Dates _without_ having *Japanese Enabler* installed, you will break the soup and lose all your data in memory. But I tested that NotePad has no problem inputing Japanese without *Japanese Enabler*." (T. Murai)

!Japanese Input Systems
    There are 6 ways.

    1. Use nJIM ([Newton Japanese Input Method|http://tmurai-web.hp.infoseek.co.jp/computers/freeware/newton/nJIM/nJIM.html], Freeware by [Tomoyoshi Murai|mailto:tmurai@mars.dtinet.or.jp].

!Cyrillic Reading Pack for Newton

Cyrillic is Joe Chen's port of a freeware X Window Cyrillic font to Newton platform (Unicode) and available from his website http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html. Also enclosed with the distribution are code translation modules for GNUE's (aka Makoto Nukui) NTEncoding, with which you're able to send/receive files with any software that supports NTEncoding (notably Steve Weyer's Newt's Cape.) The supported translations are
    # MacCyrillic (Russian) <-> Unicode
    # ISO 8859-5 <-> Unicode
    # KOI-R <-> Unicode
    # Win 1251 <-> Unicode

You can also use UniTaipeiX (avaiblable from Joe's website) which comes with full set of Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1), traditional Chinese (Big5), Japanese Kana and Kanji (JIS 208) and Cyrillic characters (KOI-R). There is also a code translator that can make it easy to share data between Newton and a desktop.


!Cyrillic Writing Pack for Newton

Joseph Chen's Cyrillic Writing Pack http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~joseph/newton/index.html includes a Cyrillic keyboard with which you can type Cyrillic in your Newton and a TapBar button for transliteration (Latin->Cyrillic). Joe is using Graffiti as keyboard and found the input of Cyrillic like a breeze.

"There is an official swedish word-list from apple as well, i happen to
use it :)
http://www.pixell.net/downloads/newton/Svensk_ordlista_Newton.sit

the swedish dictionary is not the best one dough, which, combined with
the fact that the NOS lacks the possibility to turn off the english
dictionary makes it work ... hmm ... not as good as the english one.

if the newton would be ported, i see the alt.rec features paired with
the optimisations larry suggested during WWNC  as an important part of
getting it right. the newton HWR engine could be refined a lot more
from where we stand, especially if you think international..."
