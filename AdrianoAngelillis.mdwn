## Inventor of many great Newton hardware hacks

# [[NewtLight]] -- Mini-DIN 9-to-USB adapter for use with MP 2x00's [[InterConnectPort]] and the [[InterConnectDongle]], draws power from [[InterConnectPort]] (NO USB connection!).
# [[NewtNav]] -- Serial adapter to power GPS receiver from MP2k's [[InterConnectPort]] and transfer data simultaneously. All you need now is a GPS receiver, no external power supply, hub, adapters or cables -- nothing besides besides [[InterConnectDongle]] and [[NewtNav]].
# [[NewtEye]] -- A 10.000 mcd blue LED that directly plugs into the Newton's serial port.
# [[NewtSplit]] -- Mixes Newton USB-to-Serial connectivity (Mac OS, Mac OS X, Windows, Linux) with [[NewtLight]]. Way cool!
