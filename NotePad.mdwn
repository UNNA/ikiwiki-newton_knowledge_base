The [[NotePad]] is where many Newton users do most of their work. Much like an ordinary paper notebook, a Newton [[NotePad]] may contain text, graphics, or both. You can use the [[HandWritingRecognition]], save your scribbles as [[InkText]], or draw an amusing doodle.
The [[NotePad]] is the default [[BackDrop]] application of a stock Newton.
