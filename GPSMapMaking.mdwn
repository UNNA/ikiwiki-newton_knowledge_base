*"Map making is possible, although one has to read the manual twice, better thrice. The biggest problem there is to get good maps with fine enough LON/LAT lines and scan them properly. I had a company doing this for me with a A0-scanner and got stuck later with that huge 80MB TIFF file. It choked my Mac at home (only 256MB RAM) and it needed a two Pentium LINUX machine with 1GB RAM to get in a first step the resolution down. All later processing was done on my Mac at home but then 128MB where sufficient. My advice here: Avoid large TIFF's exept you've got suitable computers to get the maps smaller.
*Another good source of maps is Route planning programs. Some of them include a feature to use GPS and draw LON/LAT lines. I made a map with such a program using the Macintosh screen copy into PICT files (CMD-SHIFT-3) and got a nice map of UK including Scotland and EIRE."

***also note that this way you can use newtscape to download maps directly to the newton. dont ask me how to save them, but im sure there is a smart way somehow..." ([Roman Pixell](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=newtontalk&m=101826905719572&w=2) 2002)
