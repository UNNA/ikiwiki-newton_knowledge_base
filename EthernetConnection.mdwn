I get reliable connection with this setup and actions:%%%
!_Setup_
Power Book G4 with Panther (Mac OS 10.3.2)%%%
AppleTalk ADSP Tool version 1.0.1 from Newton Press in the Classic system folders extensions. There may be other stuff in Classics extensions whose importance I am not aware of. %%%
From Robert: And don't forget to turn on AppleTalk in Network (System Preferences): Show: Built-in Ethernet, the Appletalk pane%%%
%%%
MP2100 OS 2.1 %%%
All ethernet packages (you could take a look at EthernetDrivers):%%%
# Newton Internet Enabler 2.0 (main package)
# Internet Setup
# NIE Ethernet
# Appropriate ethernet card drivers (see [http://www.chuma.org/newton/ethernet/] for details)
3Com 589D ethernet card with Dongle, inserted in the Newt with the ethernet cable already in, and all three drivers for that card. %%%

!_Actions_
On Newton: %%%
In 'Prefs' in Unfiled Icons:%%%
Appletalk: connect using: Ethertalk; Card: 3Com 3C589D PC Card
(the 3Com Cards do not show up in 'Card'; if a card does appear there, can't hurt to set 'Use card for Appletalk' if it presents itself).%%%

In Classic (freshly started, don't know how important, has helped when trouble, though): %%%
open NCU, select Appletalk in preferences.%%%

On Newt: %%%
tap Dock, connect via: AppleTalk, Connect to: other computer - Newt is looking, finds the G4. Select it (if not automatically selected) close box, tap connect right away.%%%

NCU lights up after some seconds. Set sync preferences. Do things.......%%%
