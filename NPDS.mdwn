[NPDS ](http://npds.free.fr/] is a [[WebServer]] for [[NewtonOS]). There is another one from a Japanese developer (I think), but I cannot find a link to it.

In fact, NPDS was first a project of [[MatthewVaughn]] who started from a sample code that appeared in PIE by [RayRischpater |http://www.lothlorien.com/dove/]. Matthew released NPDS as an [[OpenSource]] project. It was then improved by [[YoichiTakezawa]][[1]] (his website is archived by [archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20010625060510/http://www3.alpha-net.ne.jp/users/xyoichix/newton/npdsu.html], but the archive doesn't contain his packages; could somebody pls. upload to UNNA and link this here? - DJV) who added Unicode support, and at the same time by [[AdamTow]], [[VictorRehorst]] and [[PaulGuyot]). This branch is now considered by Matthew as the official branch of NPDS, although Unicode support was never added.

There is quite an extensive description of NPDS modules in the [[WebServer]] Wiki page.
