Not all modems are recognized by all models of the Newton.

Insert the modem into the PCMCIA slot and wait a second to see if the Newton pops up a window that says "A Communication card has been inserted".  If it does not say this, the modem will __not__ work.  If it does say this, the modem __may__ work.  If it does say this, try the various modem drivers built into the Newton (tap on Extras --> Prefs)

Works with the Newton Messagepad 130:
(Please note - remember to close the little plastic latch button so the Newton knows that a card is inserted)
* Megahertz 14.4 X-Jack modem, model  _XJ1144_  - works for send and receive, use "Hayes 28.8" in Prefs
* Megahertz 28.8 X-Jack modem, model  _XJ2288_  - works for send and receive, use "Hayes compatible" in Prefs

These modem cards do not work with the MP130
* Megahertz 33.6 X-Jack, model _XJ1336_ - not recognized, Newton does _not_ say "a communication card has been inserted". (but it works with a MP2000)
