So you're a Newton user who's looking for a new eBook to read. Or maybe you're about to [turn a raw etext into a Newton eBook](MakeNewtonEbooks), but would like to check if somebody has previously done this - would be a shame to do a book that's already available, wouldn't it? One might as well read the existing book and contribute the effort scheduled for making this to another one that hasn't been Newtonized yet.

Check the Newton Libraries sprinkled across the WWW - there's no complete or concise site as of this writing (April 2004), so every site has some stuff others don't have. There's treasure everywhere!
