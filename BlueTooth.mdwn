## Setup Newton-Webbrowsing via BT-enabled mobile phone


# Get the following packages (no other packages are needed! Start with the minimal set of packages and add later packages later):
** [[NIE]]: Newton Devices, Newton Internet Enabler, NIE Modem & Serial Module, Internet Setup
** [Blunt](http://www.40hz.org/Blunt/)
** [NIENitroBlunt](http://www.40hz.org/NIENitroBlunt/)
# After installing the packages, make sure that the "Connect using: Bluetooth" option is available when creating a new Internet setup. Note that NIENitroBlunt waits for twenty seconds before patching [[NIE]] to enable Bluetooth for PPP! There is no restriction where the packages are installed, internal or card as storage are fine.
# In addition to that, the following packages are recommended, but not essential for PPP:
** [Neo](http://www.40hz.org/Neo/] for [[OBEX]) connections
** [IC/VC](http://40hz.org/ICVC] to [[PutAway]) downloaded or received items
# Discover your phone
# Create a new Generic Internet Setup with the following characteristics:
** Connect using: Bluetooth
** Name: whatever
** Protocol: PPP
** Configuration: Server
** User ID: this must be checked from the operator
** Password: same, can be obtained from the operator
** When closing, disconnect: immediately
** Primary DNS/Name Server: get this from the operator as well
** Domain Name: whatever
** Logout Script:
*** send ATH0
*** send 
*** done
# Depending on the operator, username and/or password settings are needed, this is an example for T-Mobile:
** Connect using: Bluetooth
** Name: T-Mobile GPRS
** Protocol: PPP
** Configuration: Server
** User ID: dummy "This is required to complete the login, but it doesn't matter on T-Mobile's network."
** When closing, disconnect: immediately
** Primary DNS/Name Server: whatever
** Domain Name: whatever
** Logout Script:
*** send ATH0
*** send 
*** done
# One source for confusion is the setup of the phone side. If a phone uses multiple "access points" (Symbian phones), they can be selected using the AT+CGDCONT command, and if the phone uses multiple GPRS setups, they are usually selected in the ATD command (the part "***2" selects e.g. the second GPRS setup). As a guideline, start simple and add the following login script:
** send ATDT*99#
** send 
** wait for CONNECT
** done
# An alternative login script which selects a specific access point on the phone is this:
** Send: AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
** Send 
** Wait For: OK
** Send: ATD*99#
** Send 
** Wait For: CONNECT
** Done
# This login script selects the second GPRS setup:
** send ATDT*99***2#
** send 
** wait for CONNECT
** done
# Try to use some internet application, like Courier
# Choose the new T-Mobile GPRS connection, and choose your phone as peer
# Should be it!
