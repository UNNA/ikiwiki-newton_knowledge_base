A modem which posesses the barest of hardware, requiring the computer in which it is installed to do the necessary digital signal processing in order to decode the signals.  This is OK when your computer isn't otherwise occupied, doing things such as formatting web pages that are coming in over the modem, and if you are using the modem on a computer for which you have the appropriate driver software.  If not, such a modem is but a boat-anchor, not even worth the effort it would take to properly destroy before disposing of it.
