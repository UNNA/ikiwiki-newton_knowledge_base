# [[ModPlayer]]

# [[MadNewt]]

With Eckhart Köppen's [[MadNewt]] based on [[MadPlayer]] you can play MP3's on your Newton OS 2.1 Newton! It's actually not just MP3's, but internet radio too.  To get the MP3's on your Newton you'll need either Daniel Padilla's [MP3Builder for Windows | http://dev.newtontalk.net/~dpadilla/progs.htm] or Eric Schneck's iTunes [plugin | http://www.pixell.net/doppler/newton/] ([Download iTunes 2 ](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macos/9688&vid=29391)). Note that it's best to convert your MP3's to 32k or 64kbps more, 44.1hz or 22.1hz for best performance. (In iTunes this can be set in preferences.)

Some Newton Quality Internet Radio Stations:

# Alarms

On the road a need to get up in the morning? Just click on the time in the extras drawer for the option to set an alarm. Not loud or annoying enough? Try Adam Tow's "Alarm Clock" for all versions of the Newton OS. [Download ](http://www.tow.com/software/newton.shtml)

# Customize your Newton's System Sounds
See [[ChangeSystemSounds]] for where to find new sounds (Mac OS 7, Star Wars,...) and how to set them up as your new system sounds.

# Voice Recognition

With Dragon Software's [DragonDemo | http://www.unna.org/view.php?/applications/DragonDemo] and Daniel Padilla's [DragonHack 2 ](http://www.unna.org/unna/applications/[[DragonDemo]]/DragonHack2-readme.txt) you can add voice recognition to your Newton OS 2.1 Newton.%%%
Daniel also wrote [VoiceTurn | http://dev.newtontalk.net/~dpadilla/progs.htm] so, rather than pulling out your stylus every time you want to flip pages you can just tap your fingernail on the Newton case. This requires first installation of [VoiceMonitor|http://www.clubnewton.com:8080/newton/clubnewton/[[VoiceMonitor]]/[[VoiceMonitor]].html] (freeware) by the Japanese Newton developer Yos (of [Club Newton Software](http://www.clubnewton.com:8080/newton/clubnewton/index.html) fame).%%%
