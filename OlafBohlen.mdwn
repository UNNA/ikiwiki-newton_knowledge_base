Hello,

my name is Olaf Bohlen and I do things.

I'm a typical Newton user and not a programmer. I got addicted to the Newton in the year 1997 when friends of mine had some.
I bought my first Newton (MP130) in summer 1999. Soon I decided to buy a better model, so I bought myself a MP2100 in winter 1999.
My Newton is my "swapped out" brain and I really depend on it.

I'm currently trying to find a way to synchronize the Newton with the CDE (Common Desktop Environment) bundled PIM applications like dtcal, etc.
Also it would be cool to sync with Lotus Notes5/6...but I think that's impossible :)
